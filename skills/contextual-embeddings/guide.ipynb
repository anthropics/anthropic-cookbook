    "# Enhancing RAG with Contextual Retrieval\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note: For more background information on Contextual Retrieval, including additional performance evaluations on various datasets, we recommend reading our accompanying  [blog post](https://www.anthropic.com/news/contextual-retrieval).\n",
    "\n",
    "Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) enables Claude to leverage your internal knowledge bases, codebases, or any other corpus of documents when providing a response. Enterprises are increasingly building RAG applications to improve workflows in customer support, Q&A over internal company documents, financial & legal analysis, code generation, and much more.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a [separate guide](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-cookbook/blob/main/skills/retrieval_augmented_generation/guide.ipynb), we walked through setting up a basic retrieval system, demonstrated how to evaluate its performance, and then outlined a few techniques to improve performance. In this guide, we present a technique for improving retrieval performance: Contextual Embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "In traditional RAG, documents are typically split into smaller chunks for efficient retrieval. While this approach works well for many applications, it can lead to problems when individual chunks lack sufficient context. Contextual Embeddings solve this problem by adding relevant context to each chunk before embedding. This method improves the quality of each embedded chunk, allowing for more accurate retrieval and thus better overall performance. Averaged across all data sources we tested, Contextual Embeddings reduced the top-20-chunk retrieval failure rate by 35%.\n",
    "\n",
    "The same chunk-specific context can also be used with BM25 search to further improve retrieval performance. We introduce this technique in the “Contextual BM25” section.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this guide, we'll demonstrate how to build and optimize a Contextual Retrieval system using a dataset of 9 codebases as our knowledge base. We'll walk through:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Setting up a basic retrieval pipeline to establish a baseline for performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Contextual Embeddings: what it is, why it works, and how prompt caching makes it practical for production use cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Implementing Contextual Embeddings and demonstrating performance improvements.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Contextual BM25: improving performance with *contextual* BM25 hybrid search.\n",
    "\n",
    "5) Improving performance with reranking,\n",
    "\n",
    "### Evaluation Metrics & Dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "We use a pre-chunked dataset of 9 codebases - all of which have been chunked according to a basic character splitting mechanism. Our evaluation dataset contains 248 queries - each of which contains a 'golden chunk.' We'll use a metric called Pass@k to evaluate performance. Pass@k checks whether or not the 'golden document' was present in the first k documents retrieved for each query. Contextual Embeddings in this case helped us to improve Pass@10 performance from ~87% --> ~95%.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can find the code files and their chunks in `data/codebase_chunks.json` and the evaluation dataset in `data/evaluation_set.jsonl`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Additional Notes:\n",
    "\n",
    "Prompt caching is helpful in managing costs when using this retrieval method. This feature is currently available on Anthropic's 1P API, and is coming soon to our 3P partner environments in AWS Bedrock and GCP Vertex. We know that many of our customers leverage AWS Knowledge Bases and GCP Vertex AI APIs when building RAG solutions, and this method can be used on either platform with a bit of customization. Consider reaching out to Anthropic or your AWS/GCP account team for guidance on this!\n",
    "\n",
    "To make it easier to use this method on Bedrock, the AWS team has provided us with code that you can use to implement a Lambda function that adds context to each document. If you deploy this Lambda function, you can select it as a custom chunking option when configuring a [Bedrock Knowledge Base](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/knowledge-base-create.html). You can find this code in `contextual-rag-lambda-function`. The main lambda function code is in `lambda_function.py`.\n",

    "## Contextual Embeddings\n",
    "\n",
    "With basic RAG, each embedded chunk contains a potentially useful piece of information, but these chunks lack context. With Contextual Embeddings, we create a variation on the embedding itself by adding more context to each text chunk before embedding it. Specifically, we use Claude to create a concise context that explains the chunk using the context of the overall document. In the case of our codebases dataset, we can provide both the chunk and the full file that each chunk was found within to an LLM, then produce the context. Then, we will combine this 'context' and the raw text chunk together into a single text block prior to creating each embedding.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Additional Considerations: Cost and Latency\n",
    "\n",
    "The extra work we're doing to 'situate' each document happens only at ingestion time: it's a cost you'll pay once when you store each document (and periodically in the future if you have a knowledge base that updates over time). There are many approaches like HyDE (hypothetical document embeddings) which involve performing steps to improve the representation of the query prior to executing a search. These techniques have shown to be moderately effective, but they add significant latency at runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Prompt caching](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-caching) also makes this much more cost effective. Creating contextual embeddings requires us to pass the same document to the model for every chunk we want to generate extra context for. With prompt caching, we can write the overall doc to the cache once, and then because we're doing our ingestion job all in sequence, we can just read the document from cache as we generate context for each chunk within that document (the information you write to the cache has a 5 minute time to live). This means that the first time we pass a document to the model, we pay a bit more to write it to the cache, but for each subsequent API call that contains that doc, we receive  a 90% discount on all of the input tokens read from the cache. Assuming 800 token chunks, 8k token documents, 50 token context instructions, and 100 tokens of context per chunk, the cost to generate contextualized chunks is $1.02 per million document tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you load data into your ContextualVectorDB below, you'll see in logs just how big this impact is. \n",
    "\n",
    "Warning: some smaller embedding models have a fixed input token limit. Contextualizing the chunk makes it longer, so if you notice much worse performance from contextualized embeddings, the contextualized chunk is likely getting truncated"

    "## Contextual BM25\n",
    "\n",
    "Contextual embeddings is an improvement on traditional semantic search RAG, but we can improve performance further. In this section we'll show you how you can use contextual embeddings and *contextual* BM25 together. While you can see performance gains by pairing these techniques together without the context, adding context to these methods reduces the top-20-chunk retrieval failure rate by 42%.\n",
    "\n",
    "BM25 is a probabilistic ranking function that improves upon TF-IDF. It scores documents based on query term frequency, while accounting for document length and term saturation. BM25 is widely used in modern search engines for its effectiveness in ranking relevant documents. For more details, see [this blog post](https://www.elastic.co/blog/practical-bm25-part-2-the-bm25-algorithm-and-its-variables). We'll use elastic search for the BM25 portion of this section, which will require you to have the elasticsearch library installed and it will also require you to spin up an Elasticsearch server in the background. The easiest way to do this is to install [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and run the following docker command:\n",
    "\n",
    "`docker run -d --name elasticsearch -p 9200:9200 -p 9300:9300 -e \"discovery.type=single-node\" -e \"xpack.security.enabled=false\" elasticsearch:8.8.0`\n",
    "\n",
    "One difference between a typical BM25 search and what we'll do in this section is that, for each chunk, we'll run each BM25 search on both the chunk content and the additional context that we generated in the previous section. From there, we'll use a technique called reciprocal rank fusion to merge the results from our BM25 search with our semantic search results. This allows us to perform a hybrid search across both our BM25 corpus and vector DB to return the most optimal documents for a given query.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the function below, we allow you the option to add weightings to the semantic search and BM25 search documents as you merge them with Reciprocal Rank Fusion. By default, we set these to 0.8 for the semantic search results and 0.2 to the BM25 results. We'd encourage you to experiment with different values here."

    "## Adding a Reranking Step\n",

    "If you want to improve performance further, we recommend adding a re-ranking step. When using a re-ranker, you can retrieve more documents initially from your vector store, then use your re-ranker to select a subset of these documents. One common technique is to use re-ranking as a way to implement high precision hybrid search. You can use a combination of semantic search and keyword based search in your initial retrieval step (as we have done earlier in this guide), then use a re-ranking step to choose only the k most relevant docs from a combined list of documents returned by your semantic search and keyword search systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, we'll demonstrate only the re-ranking step (skipping the hybrid search technique for now). You'll see that we retrieve 10x the number of documents than the number of final k documents we want to retrieve, then use a re-ranking model from Cohere to select the 10 most relevant results from that list. Adding the re-ranking step delivers a modest additional gain in performance. In our case, Pass@10 improves from 92.81% --> 94.79%."
