    "# Retrieval Augmented Generation\n",
    "\n",
    "Claude excels at a wide range of tasks, but it may struggle with queries specific to your unique business context. This is where Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) becomes invaluable. RAG enables Claude to leverage your internal knowledge bases or customer support documents, significantly enhancing its ability to answer domain-specific questions. Enterprises are increasingly building RAG applications to improve workflows in customer support, Q&A over internal company documents, financial & legal analysis, and much more.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this guide, we'll demonstrate how to build and optimize a RAG system using the Anthropic documentation as our knowledge base. We'll walk you through:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Setting up a basic RAG system using an in-memory vector database and embeddings from [Voyage AI](https://www.voyageai.com/).\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Building a robust evaluation suite. We'll go beyond 'vibes' based evals and show you how to measure the retrieval pipeine & end to end performance independently.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Implementing advanced techniques to improve RAG including summary indexing and re-ranking with Claude.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through a series of targeted improvements, we achieved significant performance gains on the following metrics compared to a basic RAG pipeline (we'll explain what all these metrics *mean* in a bit)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Avg Precision: 0.43 --> 0.44\n",
    "- Avg Recall: 0.66 --> 0.69\n",
    "- Avg F1 Score: 0.52 --> 0.54\n",
    "- Avg Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR): 0.74 --> 0.87\n",
    "- End-to-End Accuracy: 71% --> 81%\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note:\n",
    "\n",
    "The evaluations in this cookbook are meant to mirror a production evaluation system, and you should keep in mind that they can take a while to run. Also of note: if you run the evaluations in full, you may come up against rate limits unless you are in [Tier 2 and above](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/api/rate-limits). Consider skipping the full end to end eval if you're trying to conserve token usage.\n",

    "# Metric Definitions\n",
    "We'll evaluate our system based on 5 key metrics: Precision, Recall, F1 Score, Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR), and End-to-End Accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Retrieval Metrics:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Precision\n",
    "Precision represents the proportion of retrieved chunks that are actually relevant. It answers the question: \"Of the chunks we retrieved, how many were correct?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Key points:\n",
    "- High precision indicates an efficient system with few false positives.\n",
    "- Low precision suggests many irrelevant chunks are being retrieved.\n",
    "- Our system retrieves a minimum of 3 chunks per query, which may affect precision scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "Formula:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Precision} = \\frac{\\text{True Positives}}{\\text{Total Retrieved}} = \\frac{|\\text{Retrieved} \\cap \\text{Correct}|}{|\\text{Retrieved}|}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recall\n",
    "Recall measures the completeness of our retrieval system. It answers the question: \"Of all the correct chunks that exist, how many did we manage to retrieve?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Key points:\n",
    "- High recall indicates comprehensive coverage of necessary information.\n",
    "- Low recall suggests important chunks are being missed.\n",
    "- Recall is crucial for ensuring the LLM has access to all needed information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Formula:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Recall} = \\frac{\\text{True Positives}}{\\text{Total Correct}} = \\frac{|\\text{Retrieved} \\cap \\text{Correct}|}{|\\text{Correct}|}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### F1 Score\n",
    "The F1 score provides a balanced measure between precision and recall. It's particularly useful when you need a single metric to evaluate system performance, especially with uneven class distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key points:\n",
    "- F1 score ranges from 0 to 1, with 1 representing perfect precision and recall.\n",
    "- It's the harmonic mean of precision and recall, tending towards the lower of the two values.\n",
    "- Useful in scenarios where both false positives and false negatives are important.\n",
    "\n",
    "Formula:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{F1 Score} = 2 \\times \\frac{\\text{Precision} \\times \\text{Recall}}{\\text{Precision} + \\text{Recall}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpreting F1 score:\n",
    "- An F1 score of 1.0 indicates perfect precision and recall.\n",
    "- An F1 score of 0.0 indicates the worst performance.\n",
    "- Generally, the higher the F1 score, the better the overall performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Balancing Precision, Recall, and F1 Score:\n",
    "- There's often a trade-off between precision and recall.\n",
    "- Our system's minimum chunk retrieval favors recall over precision.\n",
    "- The optimal balance depends on the specific use case.\n",
    "- In many RAG systems, high recall is often prioritized, as LLMs can filter out less relevant information during generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) @k\n",
    "MRR measures how well our system ranks relevant information. It helps us understand how quickly a user would find what they're looking for if they started from the top of our retrieved results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key points:\n",
    "- MRR ranges from 0 to 1, where 1 is perfect (correct answer always first).\n",
    "- It only considers the rank of the first correct result for each query.\n",
    "- Higher MRR indicates better ranking of relevant information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Formula:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{MRR} = \\frac{1}{|Q|} \\sum_{i=1}^{|Q|} \\frac{1}{\\text{rank}_i}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- |Q| is the total number of queries\n",
    "- rank_i is the position of the first relevant item for the i-th query\n",
    "\n",
    "## End to End Metrics:\n",
    "\n",
    "### End to End Accuracy\n",
    "We use an LLM-as-judge (Claude 3.5 Sonnet) to evaluate whether the generated answer is correct based on the question and ground truth answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Formula:\n",

    "## Level 3 - Re-Ranking with Claude\n",
    "In this final enhancement to our retrieval system, we introduce a reranking step to further improve the relevance of the retrieved documents. This approach leverages Claude's power to better understand the context and nuances of both the query and the retrieved documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `rerank_results` function uses Claude to reassess and reorder the initially retrieved documents:\n",
    "1. It presents Claude with the query and summaries of all retrieved documents.\n",
    "2. Claude is asked to select and rank the most relevant documents.\n",
    "3. The function parses Claude's response to get the reranked document indices.\n",
    "4. It includes fallback mechanisms in case of errors or insufficient results.\n",
    "5. Finally, it assigns descending relevance scores to the reranked results.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `retrieve_advanced` function implements the new retrieval pipeline:\n",
    "1. We initially retrieve more documents than needed (default 20, configurable via `initial_k`) from the vector database.\n",
    "2. We then use the `rerank_results` function to refine this larger set down to the most relevant documents (default 3, configurable via `k`).\n",
    "3. Finally, it generates a new context string from these reranked documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process casts a wider net initially and then uses AI to focus on the most pertinent information. By combining vector-based retrieval with LLM reranking, this approach aims to provide more accurate and contextually appropriate responses to user queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our evaluations show significant improvements:\n",
    "- Accuracy increased from 78% in our previous system to 85%.\n",
    "- Precision was improved by using our re-ranker to reduce the number of documents shown to the LLM.\n",
    "- MRR (Mean Reciprocal Rank) was likely improved by asking Claude to rank the relevance of each document in order.\n",
    "\n",
    "These improvements demonstrate the effectiveness of incorporating AI-powered reranking in our retrieval process."

    "This guide has illustrated the importance of measuring prompt performance empirically when prompt engineering. You can read more about our empirical methodology to prompt engineering here. Using a Jupyter Notebook is a great way to start prompt engineering but as your datasets grow larger and your prompts more numerous it is important to leverage tooling that will scale with you.\n",

    "Promptfoo makes it very easy to build automated test suites that compare different models, hyperparameter choices, and prompts against one another. \n",

    "As an example, you can run the below cell to see the average performance of Haiku vs 3.5 Sonnet across all of our test cases. "
