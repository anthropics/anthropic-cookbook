    "Some questions can't be answered by Claude off the top of Claude's head. Maybe they're about current events. Maybe you have an intensely detailed question that Claude hasn't memorized the answer to. No worries! With some prompting and scaffolding, Claude can search the web to find answers. In this notebook, we will create a virtual research assistant who has the ability to search Wikipedia to find answers to your question. The same approach can be used to allow Claude to search the broader web, or a set of documents you provide.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is the approach? Broadly it falls under the category of \"tool use\". We create a search tool, tell Claude about it, and let it go to work. In pseudocode:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Prompt Claude with a description of the search tool, how it's best used, and how to \"call\" it (by issuing a special string).\n",
    "2. Tell Claude your question.\n",
    "3. Claude produces tokens like normal. If it produces the special string, terminate the token production stream, and issue a query to a search API.\n",
    "4. Construct a new prompt which consists of the prompt from step 1, plus everything Claude generated up to the search call string, plus the results of the API call.\n",
    "5. Repeat until Claude decides it's done.\n",
