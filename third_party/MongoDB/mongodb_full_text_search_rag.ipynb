    "\n",
    "1. Set up the environment and imports\n",
    "2. Build a search tool to query an MongoDB Atlas cluster\n",
    "3. Test the search tool  \n",

      "Based on your goal of getting your daughter more interested in science, I would recommend getting her an engaging science kit or toy that allows her to conduct experiments and explore scientific concepts. The \"Scientific Explorer My First Science Experiment Kit\" seems like an excellent option that would spark her creativity and curiosity through hands-on activities like growing crystals, mixing colors, and more. This represents STEM principles that are great for kids to learn.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some other ideas would be an astronomy kit with a beginner telescope so she can gaze at planets and stars, a robotics/coding toy she can program, or a kids chemistry set to do safe experiments. Try to find kits that are open-ended to allow for discovery rather than just demonstrating a single scientific principle. Make it interactive and fun! Doing science experiments together would be a great bonding activity as well.\n",
