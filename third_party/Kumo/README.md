# Kumo <> Anthropic Cookbooks

[KumoRFM](https://kumorfm.ai/) is the worlds first foundation model for machine learning. It is the LLM equivalent of predictive modeling, where predictions are generated through in-context learning given a predictive task and underlying data. KumoRFM is also available as an [MCP Server](https://github.com/kumo-ai/kumo-rfm-mcp).

Here we provide cookbook(s) for building LLM applications using Anthropic and KumoRFM.

1. `predictive_insurance_agent.ipynb` - Notebook which showcases a simple agent which leverages `kumo-rfm-mcp` to make better decisions, shows an integration of KumoRFM and `claude-code-sdk`.
