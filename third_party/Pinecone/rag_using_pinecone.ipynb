For an older child, look for kits that tackle more advanced scientific principles like physics, engineering, robotics, etc. The key is choosing something that sparks her natural curiosity and lets her actively investigate concepts through activities, observations, and discovery. Supplement the kits with science books, museum visits, documentaries, and conversations about science she encounters in everyday life.
