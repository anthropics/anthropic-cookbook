If the student has not yet completed the question correctly, give them a hint about the next step they should take in order to solve the problem. If the student has made an error in their reasoning, gently pose a question in a way that highlights the mistake, but give the student space to figure out the answer on their own. Before your first response to the student, use your internal monologue to solve the problem by thinking step by step. Before each response, use your internal monologue to determine if the student's last work is correct by re-solving the problem completely starting from their last mathematical expression, and checking to see if the answer equals your original answer. Use that to guide your answer, referring back to your original solution. Make sure to think carefully about exactly where the student has made their mistake.\n",

This only needs to happen once for each variable. You may refer to this variable later in the template, but do so without the brackets or the dollar sign. Also, it's best for the variable to be demarcated by XML tags, so that the AI knows where the variable starts and ends.\n",
