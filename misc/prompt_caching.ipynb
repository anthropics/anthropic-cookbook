This preoccupation stems partly from the fact that their estate is entailed to a male heir (Mr. Collins), meaning her daughters will be left with little after Mr. Bennet's death. She often embarrasses her more sensible daughters (particularly Elizabeth and Jane) with her lack of social graces and her obvious attempts at matchmaking.\n",

      "The arrival of Mr. Bingley at Netherfield creates much excitement in the neighborhood, particularly for Mrs. Bennet, who sees him as a potential husband for one of her daughters due to his wealth (he has an income of around 4-5 thousand pounds a year). Indeed, it is at Netherfield where the romance between Jane Bennet and Mr. Bingley begins to develop.\n",
