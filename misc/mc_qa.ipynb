        "I. Background\n",
        "Applying for and maintaining eligibility for public benefits and services, including housing programs, often requires completing and submitting a variety of forms. HUD and its housing partners that administer its programs (including Public Housing Authorities, State and local governments, non-profit recipients of CDBG programs, Multifamily Housing owners, and FHA lenders) use the information collected by these forms to determine whether applicants are eligible or if current recipients continue to be eligible. These forms and other methods of information collections may create burdens that disproportionately fall on the most vulnerable populations and prevent individuals and entities from accessing services for which they are legally eligible. These burdens include the expenditure of time, effort, or financial resources to generate, maintain, or provide information to HUD or its housing partners. For example, individuals may be required to provide a list of family members, the family's total annual family income, the assets available to each family member in the household, and the value of such assets in order to access public housing. Individuals applying for or maintaining eligibility for public benefits or services may also face burdens such as time spent gathering records and documentation needed to prove eligibility, travel time associated with developing and submitting the collection, or even time waiting to speak with agency personnel.\n",
        "Consistent with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (PRA), 1 agencies must ensure that both the quantitative burden estimates and the narrative description supporting its information collection requests reflect the beginning-to-end experience of completing the information collection activity. Specifically, the burden faced by individuals applying for and maintaining eligibility for public benefits should also include:\n",
        "1  Public Law 104–13 (1995) (codified at 44 U.S.C. 3501–3520).\n",
        "—Information and learning costs, which refer to the time, effort, money, and other resources that individuals need to expend to learn about the existence of a public service or benefit, rules governing their eligibility and application, certification, benefits maintenance, and post-award reporting or recertification processes.\n",
        "—Compliance costs, which refer to the time, effort, money, and other resources that individuals need to expend to follow through with program application, certification, or recertification, including filling out necessary paperwork, waiting for correspondence from program agencies, planning for in-person meetings, and producing documentation to confirm their eligibility (for instance, records of household composition, income, or assets).\"\"\"\n",
