    "# Building a moderation filter with Claude\n",

    "## Basic Approach\n",
    "The basic approach is to provide Claude with a prompt that describes the categories you want to filter for (e.g. \"ALLOW\" and \"BLOCK\"), along with detailed descriptions or examples of what kinds of content should fall into each category. Then, you insert the user-generated text to be classified as part of the prompt, and ask Claude to categorize it based on the provided guidelines.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example prompt structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "You are a content moderation expert tasked with categorizing user-generated text based on the following guidelines:\n",
    "\n",
    "BLOCK CATEGORY:\n",
    "- [Description or examples of content that should be blocked]\n",
    "\n",
    "ALLOW CATEGORY:\n",
    "- [Description or examples of content that is allowed]\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the user-generated text to categorize:\n",
    "<user_text>{{USER_TEXT}}</user_text>\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the guidelines above, classify this text as either ALLOW or BLOCK. Return nothing else.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To use this, you would replace `{{USER_TEXT}}` with the actual user-generated text to be classified, and then send the prompt to Claude using the Anthropic API. Claude's response should be either \"ALLOW\" or \"BLOCK\", indicating how the text should be handled based on your provided guidelines."
