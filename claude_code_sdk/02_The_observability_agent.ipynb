While the agents we have built are already powerful, they were still limited in what they could do: the web search agent is limited to searching the internet and our Chief of Staff agent was limited to interacting with its own filesystem.\n\nThis is a serious constraint: real-world agents often need to interact with other systems like databases, APIs, file systems, and other specialized services. [MCP (Model Context Protocol)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/getting-started/intro) is an open-source standard for AI-tool integrations that allows for an easy connection between our agents and these external systems. In this notebook, we will explore how to connect MCP servers to our agent.\n\n**Need more details on MCP?** For comprehensive setup instructions, configuration best practices, and troubleshooting tips, see the [Claude Code MCP documentation](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/mcp)."

    "### 1. The Git MCP server\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's first give our agent the ability to understand and work with Git repositories. By adding the [Git MCP server](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/git) to our agent, it gains access to 13 Git-specific tools that let it examine commit history, check file changes, create branches, and even make commits. This transforms our agent from a passive observer into an active participant in your development workflow. In this example, we'll configure the agent to explore a repository's history using only Git tools. This is pretty simple, but knowing this, it is not difficult to imagine agents that can automatically create pull requests, analyze code evolution patterns, or help manage complex Git workflows across multiple repositories."

Docker is required because the GitHub MCP server runs in a containerized environment for security and isolation.\n\n**Docker Quick Setup:**\n- Install Docker Desktop from [docker.com](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)\n- Ensure Docker is running (you'll see the Docker icon in your system tray)\n- Verify with `docker --version` in your terminal\n- **Troubleshooting:** If Docker won't start, check that virtualization is enabled in your BIOS. For detailed setup instructions, see the [Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)\n\n#### Step 2: Define the mcp server and start the agent loop!"

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "We've demonstrated how the Claude Code SDK enables seamless integration with external systems through the Model Context Protocol (MCP). Starting with local Git operations through the Git MCP server, we progressively expanded to full GitHub platform integration with access to over 100 GitHub-specific tools. This transformed our agent from a local assistant into a powerful observability system capable of monitoring workflows, analyzing CI/CD failures, and providing actionable insights for production systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "By connecting MCP servers to our agent, we created an autonomous observability system that monitors GitHub Actions workflows, distinguishes between real failures and security restrictions, and provides detailed analysis of test failures. The system demonstrates how agents can actively participate in your DevOps workflow, moving from passive monitoring to intelligent incident response.\n",
    "\n",
    "This concludes, for now, our journey through the Claude Code SDK tutorial series. We've progressed from simple research agents to sophisticated multi-agent orchestration, and finally to external system integration through MCP. Together, these patterns provide the foundation for building production-ready agentic systems that can handle real-world complexity while maintaining governance, compliance, and observability.\n",
