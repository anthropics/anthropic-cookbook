    "# 00 - The One-Liner Research Agent\n",
    "\n",
    "PREFACE: We highly recommend reading [Building effective agents](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/building-effective-agents) or [How we built our multi-agent research system](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/built-multi-agent-research-system) in case you haven't. They are great reads and we will assume some basic understanding of agents! \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we build our own (re)search agent, which is inherently a great use-case because of a few reasons:\n",
    "- The input to our system is not sufficient to produce an output, meaning there needs to be interaction with external systems (e.g., the internet)\n",
    "- There is no predefined workflow we can use since it is unclear what the agent will discover during its research\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, a research agent requires the flexibility to explore unexpected leads and change direction based on what it finds. In its simplest form, a research agent can be an agent that simply searches the internet and summarizes it for you. \n",
    "\n",
    "Below, we'll implement a basic research agent with just a few lines of code. We provide Claude with exactly one tool which the Claude Code SDK contains straight out of the box: [web search tool](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/tool-use/web-search-tool). \n",
    "\n",

    "### Supercharging our agent\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we have laid out a very simple (maybe naive) implementation to illustrate how you can start leveraging the SDK to build a research agent. However, there are various ways we can improve our agent to turn it production ready. Let's cover a few of them:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Notice how before we only sent one query? In many systems, a human will look at the output of the system, potentially assigning a follow up task. Just like text completions, if we want to send multiple queries to the agent (e.g., 1. analyze abc, 2. make xyz based on your analysis) we would have to copy over the entire analysis context in our second query. Instead, we can **[use the ClaudeSDKClient](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/sdk/sdk-python#1-the-claudesdkclient-class-recommended)** to maintain the conversation context for us.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Another great way of steering the system is **providing a system prompt**, akin to a system prompt used for text completions. To learn how to write a good system prompt for a research agent, we recommend looking [here](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-cookbook/tree/main/patterns/agents/prompts).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Leveraging the `Read` tool** to enable multimodal input. This tool allows Claude to analyze charts, infographics, and complex system diagrams."
