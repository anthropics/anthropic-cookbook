      "- Input parameters: The \"expression\" parameter is clear but lacks description about syntax requirements or limitations.\n",
      "- Descriptions: The tool description is completely absent, which makes it difficult to understand what types of expressions are supported.\n",
      "- Errors encountered: The tool doesn't support common Python functions like round(), int(), or math module functions, which limits its utility for common mathematical operations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Areas for improvement:\n",
      "1. Add a clear description for the calculator tool explaining what syntax it supports and what libraries/functions are available.\n",
      "2. Include examples of supported operations in the documentation.\n",
      "3. Support common mathematical functions like round() and basic modules like math for more complex calculations.\n",
      "4. Provide better error messages that explain why an operation failed and suggest alternatives.\n",
      "5. Add documentation about what syntax to use for exponentiation and other special operations to avoid trial and error.\n",
