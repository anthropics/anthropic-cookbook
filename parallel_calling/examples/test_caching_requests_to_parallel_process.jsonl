By converting input data into machine-readable formats, businesses can leverage AI technology to transform workflows, streamline processes, and optimize performance.\n\nMachine learning is a powerful tool that has the potential to transform the way we live and work. However, the success of any machine learning model depends heavily on the quality of the training data that is used to develop it. High-quality training data is often considered to be the most critical factor in achieving accurate and reliable machine learning results.\n\nIn this blog, we\u2019ll discuss the importance of high-quality training data in machine learning and how AI embeddings can help improve it. We will cover:\n\nImportance of high-quality training data\nCreating high-quality training data using AI embeddings\nCase studies demonstrating the use of embeddings \nBest practices for using AI embeddings\nLeverage embeddings to analyze and fix your dataset and labels using Encord Active\nLearn more\nmedical banner\nImportance of High-Quality Training Data\nThe importance of high-quality training data in machine learning lies in the fact that it directly impacts the accuracy and reliability of machine learning models. For a model to accurately learn patterns and make predictions, it needs to be trained on large volumes of diverse, accurate, and unbiased data. If the data used for training is low-quality or contains inaccuracies and biases, it will produce less accurate and potentially biased predictions.\n\nThe quality of datasets being used to train models applies to every type of AI model, including Foundation Models, such as ChatGPT and Google\u2019s BERT. The Washington Post took a closer look at the vast datasets being used to train some of the world\u2019s most popular and powerful large language models (LLMs). In particular, the article reviewed the content of Google\u2019s C4 dataset, finding that quality and quantity are equally important, especially when training LLMs.  \n\nIn image recognition tasks, if the training data used to teach the model contains images with inaccurate or incomplete labels, then the model may not be able to recognize or classify similar images in its predictions accurately.\n\nAt the same time, if the training data is biased towards certain groups or demographics, then the model may learn and replicate those biases, leading to unfair or discriminatory treatment of certain groups. For instance, Google, too, succumbed to bias traps in a recent incident where its Vision AI model generated racist outcomes.\n\nblog image\n\nThe images in the BDD dataset have a pedestrian labeled as remote and book, which is clearly annotated wrongly. \n\nHence, using high-quality training data is crucial to ensuring accurate and unbiased machine learning models. This involves selecting appropriate and diverse data sources and ensuring the data is cleaned, preprocessed, and labeled accurately before being used for training.\n\nWhat is an Embedding in Machine Learning?\nIn artificial intelligence, an embedding is a mathematical representation of a set of data points in a lower-dimensional space that captures their underlying relationships and patterns. Embeddings are often used to represent complex data types, such as images, text, or audio, in a way that machine learning algorithms can easily process.\n\nEmbeddings differ from other machine learning techniques in that they are learned through training a model on a large dataset rather than being explicitly defined by a human expert. This allows the model to learn complex patterns and relationships in the data that may be difficult or impossible for a human to identify.\n\nOnce learned, embeddings can be used as features for other machine learning models, such as classifiers or regressors. This allows the model to make predictions or decisions based on the underlying patterns and relationships in the data, rather than just the raw input.\n\n\ud83d\udca1To make things easier, companies like OpenAI also offer services to extract embeddings from your data. Read to find out more.\nTypes of Embeddings\nSeveral types of embeddings can be used in machine learning, including\n\nImage Embeddings\nImage embeddings are used to represent images in a lower-dimensional space. These embeddings capture the visual features of an image, such as color and texture, allowing machine learning models to perform image classification, object detection, and other computer vision tasks.\n\nblog image\n\nExample of visualization of image embeddings. Here the BDD dataset is visualized in a 2D embedding plot on the Encord platform. \n\nWord Embeddings\nWord embeddings are used to represent words as vectors in a low-dimensional space. These embeddings capture the meaning and relationships between words, allowing machine learning models to better understand and process natural language.\n\nblog image\n\nExample of visualization of word embeddings. \n\nSource\n\nGraph Embeddings\nGraph embeddings are used to represent graphs, which are networks of interconnected nodes, as vectors in a low-dimensional space. These embeddings capture the relationships between nodes in a graph, allowing machine learning models to perform node classification and link prediction tasks.\n\nblog image\n\nLeft: The well-known Karate graph representing a social network. Right: A continuous space embedding of the nodes of the graph using DeepWalk. \n\nBy capturing the essence of the data in a lower-dimensional space, embeddings enable efficient computation and discovery of complex patterns and relationships that might not be otherwise apparent. These benefits enable various applications of AI embeddings, as discussed below.\n\nApplications of Embeddings\nAI embeddings have numerous applications in data creation and machine learning, including\n\nImproving Data Quality\nAI embeddings can help improve data quality by reducing noise, removing outliers, and capturing semantic relationships. This is particularly useful in scenarios where the data needs to be more structured or contain missing values. For example, in natural language processing, word embeddings can represent words with similar meanings closer together, enabling better semantic understanding and enhancing the accuracy of various language-related tasks.\n\n\ud83d\udca1Read 5 ways to improve the quality of the training data.\nReducing the Need for Manual Data Labeling\nAI embeddings can automatically label data based on its embedding representation. This can save time and resources, especially when dealing with large datasets.\n\nReducing Computation\nEmbeddings are useful in reducing computation by representing high-dimensional data in a lower-dimensional space. For example, a 256 x 256 image contains 65,536 pixels in image processing, resulting in many features if directly used. Using a CNN, the image can be transformed into a 1000-dimensional feature vector, consolidating the information. This compression significantly reduces computational requirements, approximately 65 times less, allowing for more efficient image processing and analysis without sacrificing essential details.\n\nEnhancing Natual Language Processing (NLP)\nWord embeddings are widely used in NLP applications such as sentiment analysis, language translation, and chatbot development. Mapping words to vector representations makes it easier for machine learning algorithms to understand the relationships between words.\n\nblog image\n\nSource\n\nImproving Recommendation Systems\nCollaborative filtering, a type of recommendation system uses user and item embeddings to make personalized recommendations. By embedding user and item data in a vector space, the algorithm, can identify similar items and recommend them to users.\n\nEnhancing Image and Video Processing\nImage and video embeddings can be used for object detection, recognition, and classification. Mapping images and videos to vector representations makes it easier for machine learning algorithms to identify and classify different objects within them.\n\nHence, the applications of AI embeddings are diverse and offer many benefits, including improving data quality and reducing the need for manual data labeling. Now, let's delve into how this can be beneficial when utilizing AI embeddings for generating high-quality training data.\n\nFrom scaling to enhancing your model development with data-driven insights\nLearn more\nmedical banner\nBenefits of Embeddings in Data Creation\nHere are a few of the benefits of using embeddings in data creation:\n\nCreate a Larger and Diverse Dataset\nBy automatically identifying patterns and relationships within data, embeddings can help to fill in gaps and identify outliers that might be missed by manual labeling. For example, embeddings can help fill in gaps by leveraging the learned patterns and relationships within the data. \n\nAI models can make informed estimations or predictions for missing values by analyzing the surrounding representations, allowing for more complete and reliable data analysis. This can help improve the accuracy of machine learning models by providing more comprehensive and representative data for training.\n\nblog image\n\nSource\n\nReduce Bias\nUsing AI embeddings in training data can help reduce bias by enabling a more nuanced understanding of the relationships and patterns in the data, allowing for identifying and mitigating potential sources of bias. This can help to ensure that machine learning models are trained on fair and representative data, leading to more accurate and unbiased predictions.\n\n\ud83d\udca1Read to find out five more ways to reduce bias in your training data.\nImprove Model Performance\nAI embeddings offer several benefits such as increased efficiency, better generalization, and enhanced performance in various machine learning tasks. They enable efficient computation and discovery of complex patterns, reduce overfitting, and capture the underlying structure of the data to generalize better on new, unseen data.\n\nHow to Create High-Quality Training Data Using Embeddings\nData Preparation\nThe first step is preparing the data for embedding. The data preparation step is crucial for embedding because the input data's quality determines the resulting embeddings' quality. \n\nThe first step is to collect the data you want to use for training your model. This can include text data, image data, or graph data. Once you have collected the data, you need to clean and preprocess it to remove any noise or irrelevant information. For example, in text data, data cleaning involves:\n\nTokenizing the text into individual words or phrases.\nRemoving stop words.\nCorrecting spelling errors.\nRemoving punctuation marks.\nYou may need to resize or crop images to a uniform size for image data.\n\nIf the data is noisy, unstructured, or contains irrelevant information, the embeddings may not accurately represent the data and may not provide the desired results. Proper data preparation can help improve the quality of embeddings, leading to more accurate and efficient machine learning models. \n\nFor example, the pre-processing step of image data preparation involves removing image duplicates and images that have no information like extremely dark or overly bright images.\n\n\ud83d\udca1Read the blog on data curation and data curation tools to gain more insight on how to choose the right datasets for your computer vision or machine learning model.\nEmbedding using Machine Learning Techniques\nMost machine learning algorithms require numerical data as input. Therefore, you need to convert the data into a numerical format. This can involve creating a bag of words representation for text data, converting images into pixel values, or transforming graph data into a numerical matrix.\n\nOnce you have converted the data into a numerical format, you can embed it using machine learning techniques. The embedding process involves mapping the data from a higher-dimensional space to a lower-dimensional space while preserving its semantic meaning. Some of the popular embedding techniques are:\n\nScale your annotation workflows and power your model performance with data-driven insights\nTry Encord today\nmedical banner\nPrincipal Component Analysis (PCA) & Single Value Decomposition (SVD)\nPrincipal Component Analysis (PCA) is a dimensionality reduction technique that transforms the original data into a set of new, uncorrelated features (called principal components). It captures the most important information in the data while discarding the less important information.\n\nTo perform PCA for embedding, the original data is first centered and scaled to have zero mean and unit variance. Next, the covariance matrix of the centered data is calculated. The eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the covariance matrix are then computed, and the eigenvectors are sorted in descending order based on their corresponding eigenvalues. The top k eigenvectors are then selected to form the new feature space, where k is the desired dimensionality of the embedded space.\n\nblog image\n\nAn example where we transform five data points using PCA. The left graph is our original data; the right graph would be our transformed data. The two charts show the same data, but the right graph reflects the original data transformed so that the axes are now the principal components.\n\nSource\n\nFinally, the original data is projected onto the new feature space using the selected eigenvectors to obtain the embedded representation. PCA is a widely used technique for embedding, particularly for image and audio data, and has been used in a variety of applications such as facial recognition and speech recognition.\n\nSingular Value Decomposition (SVD) is used within PCA, so we will only cover this briefly. SVD decomposes a matrix into three matrices: U, \u03a3, and V. U represents the left singular vectors, S represents the singular values, and V represents the right singular vectors.\n\nblog image\n\nEquation of the SVD theorem.\n\nThe singular values and vectors capture the most important information in the original matrix, allowing for dimensionality reduction and embedding creation. Similar to PCA, SVD can be used to create embeddings for various types of data, including text, images, and graphs.\n\nSVD has been used for various machine learning tasks, such as recommendation systems, text classification, and image processing. It is a powerful technique for creating high-quality embeddings that can improve the performance of machine learning models.\n\nAuto-Encoder\nAutoencoders are neural network models used for unsupervised learning. They consist of an encoder network that maps the input data to a lower-dimensional representation (encoding) and a decoder network that attempts to reconstruct the original input data from the encoding. An autoencoder aims to learn a compressed and meaningful representation of the input data, effectively capturing the essential features.\n\nAutoencoders consist of an encoder neural network that compresses the input data into a lower-dimensional representation or embedding. The decoder network reconstructs the original data from the embedding. By training an eutoencoder on a dataset, the encoder network learns to extract meaningful features and compress the input data into a compact representation. These embeddings can be used for downstream tasks such as clustering, visualization, or transfer learning. \n\nWord2Vec\nWord2Vec is a popular technique for creating word embeddings, which represent words in a high-dimensional vector space. The technique works by training a neural network on a large corpus of text data, to predict the context in which a given word appears. The resulting embeddings capture semantic and syntactic relationships between words, such as similarity and analogy.\n\nWord2Vec is effective in various natural language processing tasks, such as language translation, text classification, and sentiment analysis. It also has applications in recommendation systems and image analysis.\n\nThere are two main approaches to implementing Word2Vec: the Continuous Bag-of-Words (CBOW) model and the Skip-gram model. CBOW predicts a target word given its surrounding context, while Skip-gram predicts the context given a target word. Both models have their advantages and disadvantages, and the choice between them depends on the specific application and the characteristics of the data.\n\nblog image\n\nLeft: CBOW architecture. Right: Skip-gram architecture. The CBOW architecture predicts the current word based on the context, and the Skip-gram predicts surrounding words given the current word.\n\nSource\n\nGloVe\nGloVe, which stands for Global Vectors for Word Representation, is another popular embedding technique that is used to represent words as vectors. Like Word2Vec, GloVe is also a neural network-based approach. However, unlike Word2Vec, which is based on a shallow neural network, GloVe uses a global matrix factorization technique to learn word embeddings.\n\nIn GloVe, the co-occurrence matrix of words is constructed by counting the number of times two words appear together in a given context. The rows of the matrix represent the words, and the columns represent the context in which the words appear. The matrix is then factorized into two separate matrices, one for words and the other for contexts. The product of these two matrices produces the final word embeddings.\n\nblog image\n\nExample of the GloVe embeddings.\n\nSource\n\nGloVe is known to perform well on various NLP tasks such as word analogy, word similarity, and named entity recognition. Additionally, GloVe has also been used for image classification tasks by converting image features into word-like entities and applying GloVe embeddings.\n\nBERT\nBERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a popular language model developed by Google that has been used for a variety of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including embedding. BERT is a deep learning model that uses a transformer architecture to generate word embeddings by taking into account the context of the words. This allows BERT to capture the semantic meaning of words, as well as the relationships between words in a sentence.\n\nblog image\n\nBERT is a pre-trained model that has been trained on massive amounts of text data, making it a powerful tool for generating high-quality word embeddings. BERT-based embeddings are highly effective in a range of NLP tasks, including sentiment analysis, text classification, and question-answering. Additionally, BERT allows for fine-tuning specific downstream tasks, which can lead to even more accurate results.\n\nblog image\n\nOverall pre-training and fine-tuning procedure for BERT\n\nSource\n\nOverall, BERT is a powerful tool for generating high-quality word embeddings that can be used in a wide range of NLP applications. One downside of BERT is that it can be computationally expensive, requiring significant resources for training and inference. However, pre-trained BERT models can be fine-tuned for specific use cases, reducing the need for expensive training.\n\nt-SNE\nt-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) is a widely used dimensionality reduction technique for visualizing high-dimensional data. While t-SNE is primarily used for visualization, it can also be used to generate embeddings. The process involves applying t-SNE to reduce the dimensionality of the data and obtaining a lower-dimensional embedding that captures the inherent structure of the original high-dimensional data.\n\nblog image\n\nSource\n\nt-SNE works by creating a probability distribution that measures the similarity between data points in high-dimensional space and a corresponding probability distribution in the low-dimensional space. It then minimizes the Kullback-Leibler divergence between these distributions to find an embedding that preserves the pairwise similarities between points.\n\nThe resulting embeddings from t-SNE can be used for various purposes such as clustering, anomaly detection, or as input to downstream machine learning algorithms. However, it's important to note that t-SNE is computationally expensive, and the generated embeddings should be interpreted carefully since they emphasize local structure and may not preserve the precise distances between points\n\nUMAP\nUMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) is a dimensionality reduction technique commonly used for generating embeddings. Unlike traditional methods like PCA or t-SNE, UMAP focuses on preserving both local and global structure in the data while maintaining computational efficiency.\n\nblog image\n\nSource\n\nUMAP works by constructing a low-dimensional representation of the data while preserving the neighborhood relationships. It achieves this by modeling the data as a topological structure and approximating the manifold on which the data lies. The algorithm iteratively optimizes a low-dimensional embedding that preserves the pairwise distances between nearby points.\n\nApplying UMAP to a dataset generates embeddings that capture the underlying structure and relationships in the data. These embeddings can be used for various purposes, such as visualization, clustering, or as input to other machine learning algorithms.\n\nUMAP has gained popularity in various domains, including image analysis, genomics, text mining, and recommendation systems, due to its ability to generate high-quality embeddings that preserve both local and global structures while being computationally efficient.\n\nAnalyzing and validating embeddings is an important step in quality assurance to ensure that the generated embeddings accurately represent the underlying data.\n\nScale your annotation workflows and power your model performance with data-driven insights\nTry Encord today\nmedical banner\nAnalyzing and Validating Embeddings for Quality Assurance\nOne common method for analyzing embeddings is to visualize them in a lower-dimensional space, such as 2D or 3D, using techniques like t-SNE or PCA. This can help identify clusters or patterns in the data and provide insights into the quality of the embeddings.\n\nThere are platforms that create and plot the embeddings of the dataset. These plots are helpful when you want to visualize your dataset in the lower-dimensional space. Visualizing the data in this lower-dimensional space makes it easier to identify any potential issues or biases in the data, which can be addressed to improve the quality of the embeddings. Visualizing embeddings can help evaluate and compare different models by providing an intuitive way to assess the quality and usefulness of the embeddings for specific tasks.\n\nOne example is the Encord Active platform, which provides a 2D embedding plot of an image dataset, enabling users to visualize the images within a particular cluster. This simplifies the process of identifying outliers through embeddings. The 2D embedding plot is not only useful in validating the data quality but also the label quality of the dataset.\n\nblog image\n\nA 2D embedding plot of the Rareplanes dataset\n\nValidation of embeddings involves evaluating their performance on downstream tasks, such as classification or prediction, and comparing it with other methods. This can help determine the effectiveness of the embeddings in real-world scenarios and highlight areas for improvement.\n\nAnother aspect of validation is measuring the degree of bias present in the embeddings. This is important because embeddings can reflect biases in the training data, leading to discriminatory or unfair outcomes. Techniques like de-biasing can be used to remove these biases and ensure that the embeddings are fair and unbiased.\n\nvector-try-encord\nScale your annotation workflows and power your model performance with data-driven insights\nTry Encord today\nmedical banner\nNow that we have explored the creation and analysis of embeddings, let's examine a case study to gain a deeper understanding of how embeddings can benefit machine learning models when compared to traditional machine learning algorithms.\n\nCase Study: Embeddings and Object Classification\nThis case study focuses on the effect of embeddings on object classification algorithms. By visualizing the embeddings of the training dataset, we can explore their impact on the process.\n\nImage classification is a popular application of machine learning, and embeddings are effective for this task. Embedding-based approaches to image classification involve learning a lower-dimensional representation of the image data and using this representation as input to a machine learning model.\n\nblog image\n\nExample of dog classification \n\nAnalyzing the embeddings can reduce the need for manual feature engineering. Compared to traditional machine learning algorithms, embedding-based approaches enable more efficient computation. Hence, the trained model will often achieve higher accuracy and better generalization to new, unseen data. Let's visualize the embeddings to understand this better.\n\nVisualizing embeddings\nHere, we will be using the Encord Active platform to visualize the embedding plot of the Caltech-101 dataset. \n\nThe Caltech-101 dataset consists of images of objects categorized into 101 classes. Each image in the dataset has different dimensions, but they are generally of medium resolution, with dimensions ranging from 200 x 200 to 500 x 500 pixels. However, the number of dimensions in the dataset will depend on the number of features used to represent each image. In general, most Caltech-101 image features will have hundreds or thousands of dimensions and it will be helpful to visualize it in lower-dimensional space.\n\nblog image\n\nExample of images presented in Caltech101 dataset\n\nSource\n\nRun the following commands in your favorite Python environment with the following commands will download Encord Active:\n\npython3.9 -m venv ea-venv\nsource ea-venv/bin/activate\n# within venv\npip install encord-active\nOr you can follow through the following command to install Encord Active using GitHub:\n\npip install git+https://github.com/encord-team/encord-active\nTo check if Encord Active has been installed, run:\n\nencord-active --help\nEncord Active has many sandbox datasets like the MNIST, BDD100K, TACO dataset, and much more. Caltech101 dataset is one of them. These sandbox datasets are commonly used in computer vision applications for building benchmark models.\n\nNow that you have Encord Active installed, let\u2019s download the Caltech101 dataset by running the command:\n\nencord-active download\nThe script asks you to choose a project, navigate the options \u2193 and \u2191 select the Caltech-101 train or test dataset, and hit enter. The dataset has been pre-divided into a training set comprising 60% of the data and a testing set comprising the rest 40% of the data for the convenience of analyzing the dataset.\n\nEasy! Now, you got your data. To visualize the data in the browser, run the command:\n\ncd /path/to/downloaded/project\nencord-active visualize\nThe image below shows the webpage that opens in your browser showing the training data and its properties.\n\nblog image\n\nVisualize the data in your browser (data = Caltech-101 training data-60% of Caltech-101 dataset)\n\nThe 2D embedding plot can be found in the Explorer pages of the Data Quality and Label Quality sections.\n\nblog image\n\nThe 2D embedding plot in the Data Quality Explorer page of Encord.\n\nThe 2D embedding plot here is a scatter plot with each point representing a data point in the dataset. The position of each point on the plot reflects the relative similarity or dissimilarity of the data points with respect to each other. For example, select the box or the Lasso Select in the upper right corner of the plot. Once you select a region, you can visualize the images only in the selected region.\n\nblog image\n\nBy projecting the data into two dimensions, you can now see clusters of similar data points, outliers, and other patterns that may be useful for data analysis.\n\nblog image\n\nFor example, we see in the selected cluster, there is one outlier.\n\nThe 2D embedding plot in label quality shows the data points of each image and each color represents the class the object belongs to. This helps in finding out the outliers by spotting the unexpected relationships or possible areas of model bias for object labels. \n\nThis plot also shows the separability of the dataset. A separable dataset is useful for object recognition because it allows for the use of simpler and more efficient computer vision models that can achieve high accuracy with relatively few parameters. \n\nblog image\n\nThe 2D embedding plot in the Label Quality Explorer page of Encord.\n\nA separable dataset is a useful starting point for object classification, as it allows us to quickly develop and evaluate simple machine learning models before exploring more complex models if needed. It also helps us better understand the data and the features that distinguish the different classes of objects, which can be useful for developing more sophisticated models in the future.\n\n\ud83d\udca1Read the detailed analysis of the Caltech101 dataset to understand the dataset better. You can also find out how to visualize and analyze your training data!\nSo far, we have discussed various types of embeddings and how they can be used for analyzing and improving the quality of training data.

It\u2019s essential to carefully consider the data and the task at hand before selecting an embedding technique. It is also important to remember the computational resources required for the embedding technique and the size of the resulting embeddings.\n\nIt\u2019s also important to stay up to date with the latest research and techniques in the field of AI embeddings. This can help ensure that the most effective and efficient embedding techniques are used for creating high-quality training data.\n\nAddressing Data Bias and Ensuring Data Diversity\nUsing a large and diverse dataset for generating embeddings for the training data is a good way to ensure the embeddings address the bias in the dataset. This helps capture the full range of variation in the data and results in more accurate embeddings.\n\nValidating the Embeddings\nAnalyzing the embeddings to validate their quality is a crucial step. The embeddings should be evaluated and validated to ensure that they capture the relevant information and can be used effectively for the task at hand. Visualization of the embeddings in a lower-dimensional space can help identify any patterns or clusters in the data and aid in the validation process.\n\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, AI embeddings are powerful tools for creating high-quality training data in machine learning. By using embeddings, data scientists can improve data quality, reduce the need for manual data labeling, and enable more efficient computation. Best practices for using AI embeddings include:\n\nChoosing appropriate techniques.\nAddressing data bias and ensuring diversity.\nUnderstanding limitations that could impact data quality.\nAI embeddings have a promising future in machine learning, and we recommend implementing them in data creation whenever possible.\n\nFuture Directions\nIn the future, we can expect to see more sophisticated embedding techniques and tools, as well as increased use of embeddings in a wide range of applications beyond image and text classification. For example, Meta AI\u2019s new model ImageBIND is a machine learning model that creates a joint embedding space for multiple modalities, such as images, text, and audio. The model is designed to enable the effective integration of multiple modalities and improve performance on a variety of multi-modal machine learning tasks.\n", "cache_control": {"type": "ephemeral"}}], "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What company published this blog?"}]}

These embeddings capture the relationships between nodes in a graph, allowing machine learning models to perform node classification and link prediction tasks.\n\nblog image\n\nLeft: The well-known Karate graph representing a social network. Right: A continuous space embedding of the nodes of the graph using DeepWalk. \n\nBy capturing the essence of the data in a lower-dimensional space, embeddings enable efficient computation and discovery of complex patterns and relationships that might not be otherwise apparent. These benefits enable various applications of AI embeddings, as discussed below.\n\nApplications of Embeddings\nAI embeddings have numerous applications in data creation and machine learning, including\n\nImproving Data Quality\nAI embeddings can help improve data quality by reducing noise, removing outliers, and capturing semantic relationships. This is particularly useful in scenarios where the data needs to be more structured or contain missing values. For example, in natural language processing, word embeddings can represent words with similar meanings closer together, enabling better semantic understanding and enhancing the accuracy of various language-related tasks.\n\n\ud83d\udca1Read 5 ways to improve the quality of the training data.\nReducing the Need for Manual Data Labeling\nAI embeddings can automatically label data based on its embedding representation. This can save time and resources, especially when dealing with large datasets.\n\nReducing Computation\nEmbeddings are useful in reducing computation by representing high-dimensional data in a lower-dimensional space. For example, a 256 x 256 image contains 65,536 pixels in image processing, resulting in many features if directly used. Using a CNN, the image can be transformed into a 1000-dimensional feature vector, consolidating the information. This compression significantly reduces computational requirements, approximately 65 times less, allowing for more efficient image processing and analysis without sacrificing essential details.\n\nEnhancing Natual Language Processing (NLP)\nWord embeddings are widely used in NLP applications such as sentiment analysis, language translation, and chatbot development. Mapping words to vector representations makes it easier for machine learning algorithms to understand the relationships between words.\n\nblog image\n\nSource\n\nImproving Recommendation Systems\nCollaborative filtering, a type of recommendation system uses user and item embeddings to make personalized recommendations. By embedding user and item data in a vector space, the algorithm, can identify similar items and recommend them to users.\n\nEnhancing Image and Video Processing\nImage and video embeddings can be used for object detection, recognition, and classification. Mapping images and videos to vector representations makes it easier for machine learning algorithms to identify and classify different objects within them.\n\nHence, the applications of AI embeddings are diverse and offer many benefits, including improving data quality and reducing the need for manual data labeling. Now, let's delve into how this can be beneficial when utilizing AI embeddings for generating high-quality training data.\n\nFrom scaling to enhancing your model development with data-driven insights\nLearn more\nmedical banner\nBenefits of Embeddings in Data Creation\nHere are a few of the benefits of using embeddings in data creation:\n\nCreate a Larger and Diverse Dataset\nBy automatically identifying patterns and relationships within data, embeddings can help to fill in gaps and identify outliers that might be missed by manual labeling. For example, embeddings can help fill in gaps by leveraging the learned patterns and relationships within the data. \n\nAI models can make informed estimations or predictions for missing values by analyzing the surrounding representations, allowing for more complete and reliable data analysis. This can help improve the accuracy of machine learning models by providing more comprehensive and representative data for training.\n\nblog image\n\nSource\n\nReduce Bias\nUsing AI embeddings in training data can help reduce bias by enabling a more nuanced understanding of the relationships and patterns in the data, allowing for identifying and mitigating potential sources of bias. This can help to ensure that machine learning models are trained on fair and representative data, leading to more accurate and unbiased predictions.\n\n\ud83d\udca1Read to find out five more ways to reduce bias in your training data.\nImprove Model Performance\nAI embeddings offer several benefits such as increased efficiency, better generalization, and enhanced performance in various machine learning tasks. They enable efficient computation and discovery of complex patterns, reduce overfitting, and capture the underlying structure of the data to generalize better on new, unseen data.\n\nHow to Create High-Quality Training Data Using Embeddings\nData Preparation\nThe first step is preparing the data for embedding. The data preparation step is crucial for embedding because the input data's quality determines the resulting embeddings' quality. \n\nThe first step is to collect the data you want to use for training your model. This can include text data, image data, or graph data. Once you have collected the data, you need to clean and preprocess it to remove any noise or irrelevant information. For example, in text data, data cleaning involves:\n\nTokenizing the text into individual words or phrases.\nRemoving stop words.\nCorrecting spelling errors.\nRemoving punctuation marks.\nYou may need to resize or crop images to a uniform size for image data.\n\nIf the data is noisy, unstructured, or contains irrelevant information, the embeddings may not accurately represent the data and may not provide the desired results. Proper data preparation can help improve the quality of embeddings, leading to more accurate and efficient machine learning models. \n\nFor example, the pre-processing step of image data preparation involves removing image duplicates and images that have no information like extremely dark or overly bright images.\n\n\ud83d\udca1Read the blog on data curation and data curation tools to gain more insight on how to choose the right datasets for your computer vision or machine learning model.\nEmbedding using Machine Learning Techniques\nMost machine learning algorithms require numerical data as input. Therefore, you need to convert the data into a numerical format. This can involve creating a bag of words representation for text data, converting images into pixel values, or transforming graph data into a numerical matrix.\n\nOnce you have converted the data into a numerical format, you can embed it using machine learning techniques. The embedding process involves mapping the data from a higher-dimensional space to a lower-dimensional space while preserving its semantic meaning. Some of the popular embedding techniques are:\n\nScale your annotation workflows and power your model performance with data-driven insights\nTry Encord today\nmedical banner\nPrincipal Component Analysis (PCA) & Single Value Decomposition (SVD)\nPrincipal Component Analysis (PCA) is a dimensionality reduction technique that transforms the original data into a set of new, uncorrelated features (called principal components). It captures the most important information in the data while discarding the less important information.\n\nTo perform PCA for embedding, the original data is first centered and scaled to have zero mean and unit variance. Next, the covariance matrix of the centered data is calculated. The eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the covariance matrix are then computed, and the eigenvectors are sorted in descending order based on their corresponding eigenvalues. The top k eigenvectors are then selected to form the new feature space, where k is the desired dimensionality of the embedded space.\n\nblog image\n\nAn example where we transform five data points using PCA. The left graph is our original data; the right graph would be our transformed data. The two charts show the same data, but the right graph reflects the original data transformed so that the axes are now the principal components.\n\nSource\n\nFinally, the original data is projected onto the new feature space using the selected eigenvectors to obtain the embedded representation. PCA is a widely used technique for embedding, particularly for image and audio data, and has been used in a variety of applications such as facial recognition and speech recognition.\n\nSingular Value Decomposition (SVD) is used within PCA, so we will only cover this briefly. SVD decomposes a matrix into three matrices: U, \u03a3, and V. U represents the left singular vectors, S represents the singular values, and V represents the right singular vectors.\n\nblog image\n\nEquation of the SVD theorem.\n\nThe singular values and vectors capture the most important information in the original matrix, allowing for dimensionality reduction and embedding creation. Similar to PCA, SVD can be used to create embeddings for various types of data, including text, images, and graphs.\n\nSVD has been used for various machine learning tasks, such as recommendation systems, text classification, and image processing. It is a powerful technique for creating high-quality embeddings that can improve the performance of machine learning models.\n\nAuto-Encoder\nAutoencoders are neural network models used for unsupervised learning. They consist of an encoder network that maps the input data to a lower-dimensional representation (encoding) and a decoder network that attempts to reconstruct the original input data from the encoding. An autoencoder aims to learn a compressed and meaningful representation of the input data, effectively capturing the essential features.\n\nAutoencoders consist of an encoder neural network that compresses the input data into a lower-dimensional representation or embedding. The decoder network reconstructs the original data from the embedding. By training an eutoencoder on a dataset, the encoder network learns to extract meaningful features and compress the input data into a compact representation. These embeddings can be used for downstream tasks such as clustering, visualization, or transfer learning. \n\nWord2Vec\nWord2Vec is a popular technique for creating word embeddings, which represent words in a high-dimensional vector space. The technique works by training a neural network on a large corpus of text data, to predict the context in which a given word appears. The resulting embeddings capture semantic and syntactic relationships between words, such as similarity and analogy.\n\nWord2Vec is effective in various natural language processing tasks, such as language translation, text classification, and sentiment analysis. It also has applications in recommendation systems and image analysis.\n\nThere are two main approaches to implementing Word2Vec: the Continuous Bag-of-Words (CBOW) model and the Skip-gram model. CBOW predicts a target word given its surrounding context, while Skip-gram predicts the context given a target word. Both models have their advantages and disadvantages, and the choice between them depends on the specific application and the characteristics of the data.\n\nblog image\n\nLeft: CBOW architecture. Right: Skip-gram architecture. The CBOW architecture predicts the current word based on the context, and the Skip-gram predicts surrounding words given the current word.\n\nSource\n\nGloVe\nGloVe, which stands for Global Vectors for Word Representation, is another popular embedding technique that is used to represent words as vectors. Like Word2Vec, GloVe is also a neural network-based approach. However, unlike Word2Vec, which is based on a shallow neural network, GloVe uses a global matrix factorization technique to learn word embeddings.\n\nIn GloVe, the co-occurrence matrix of words is constructed by counting the number of times two words appear together in a given context. The rows of the matrix represent the words, and the columns represent the context in which the words appear. The matrix is then factorized into two separate matrices, one for words and the other for contexts. The product of these two matrices produces the final word embeddings.\n\nblog image\n\nExample of the GloVe embeddings.\n\nSource\n\nGloVe is known to perform well on various NLP tasks such as word analogy, word similarity, and named entity recognition. Additionally, GloVe has also been used for image classification tasks by converting image features into word-like entities and applying GloVe embeddings.\n\nBERT\nBERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a popular language model developed by Google that has been used for a variety of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including embedding. BERT is a deep learning model that uses a transformer architecture to generate word embeddings by taking into account the context of the words. This allows BERT to capture the semantic meaning of words, as well as the relationships between words in a sentence.\n\nblog image\n\nBERT is a pre-trained model that has been trained on massive amounts of text data, making it a powerful tool for generating high-quality word embeddings. BERT-based embeddings are highly effective in a range of NLP tasks, including sentiment analysis, text classification, and question-answering. Additionally, BERT allows for fine-tuning specific downstream tasks, which can lead to even more accurate results.\n\nblog image\n\nOverall pre-training and fine-tuning procedure for BERT\n\nSource\n\nOverall, BERT is a powerful tool for generating high-quality word embeddings that can be used in a wide range of NLP applications. One downside of BERT is that it can be computationally expensive, requiring significant resources for training and inference. However, pre-trained BERT models can be fine-tuned for specific use cases, reducing the need for expensive training.\n\nt-SNE\nt-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) is a widely used dimensionality reduction technique for visualizing high-dimensional data. While t-SNE is primarily used for visualization, it can also be used to generate embeddings. The process involves applying t-SNE to reduce the dimensionality of the data and obtaining a lower-dimensional embedding that captures the inherent structure of the original high-dimensional data.\n\nblog image\n\nSource\n\nt-SNE works by creating a probability distribution that measures the similarity between data points in high-dimensional space and a corresponding probability distribution in the low-dimensional space. It then minimizes the Kullback-Leibler divergence between these distributions to find an embedding that preserves the pairwise similarities between points.\n\nThe resulting embeddings from t-SNE can be used for various purposes such as clustering, anomaly detection, or as input to downstream machine learning algorithms. However, it's important to note that t-SNE is computationally expensive, and the generated embeddings should be interpreted carefully since they emphasize local structure and may not preserve the precise distances between points\n\nUMAP\nUMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) is a dimensionality reduction technique commonly used for generating embeddings. Unlike traditional methods like PCA or t-SNE, UMAP focuses on preserving both local and global structure in the data while maintaining computational efficiency.\n\nblog image\n\nSource\n\nUMAP works by constructing a low-dimensional representation of the data while preserving the neighborhood relationships. It achieves this by modeling the data as a topological structure and approximating the manifold on which the data lies. The algorithm iteratively optimizes a low-dimensional embedding that preserves the pairwise distances between nearby points.\n\nApplying UMAP to a dataset generates embeddings that capture the underlying structure and relationships in the data. These embeddings can be used for various purposes, such as visualization, clustering, or as input to other machine learning algorithms.\n\nUMAP has gained popularity in various domains, including image analysis, genomics, text mining, and recommendation systems, due to its ability to generate high-quality embeddings that preserve both local and global structures while being computationally efficient.\n\nAnalyzing and validating embeddings is an important step in quality assurance to ensure that the generated embeddings accurately represent the underlying data.\n\nScale your annotation workflows and power your model performance with data-driven insights\nTry Encord today\nmedical banner\nAnalyzing and Validating Embeddings for Quality Assurance\nOne common method for analyzing embeddings is to visualize them in a lower-dimensional space, such as 2D or 3D, using techniques like t-SNE or PCA. This can help identify clusters or patterns in the data and provide insights into the quality of the embeddings.\n\nThere are platforms that create and plot the embeddings of the dataset. These plots are helpful when you want to visualize your dataset in the lower-dimensional space. Visualizing the data in this lower-dimensional space makes it easier to identify any potential issues or biases in the data, which can be addressed to improve the quality of the embeddings. Visualizing embeddings can help evaluate and compare different models by providing an intuitive way to assess the quality and usefulness of the embeddings for specific tasks.\n\nOne example is the Encord Active platform, which provides a 2D embedding plot of an image dataset, enabling users to visualize the images within a particular cluster. This simplifies the process of identifying outliers through embeddings. The 2D embedding plot is not only useful in validating the data quality but also the label quality of the dataset.\n\nblog image\n\nA 2D embedding plot of the Rareplanes dataset\n\nValidation of embeddings involves evaluating their performance on downstream tasks, such as classification or prediction, and comparing it with other methods. This can help determine the effectiveness of the embeddings in real-world scenarios and highlight areas for improvement.\n\nAnother aspect of validation is measuring the degree of bias present in the embeddings. This is important because embeddings can reflect biases in the training data, leading to discriminatory or unfair outcomes. Techniques like de-biasing can be used to remove these biases and ensure that the embeddings are fair and unbiased.\n\nvector-try-encord\nScale your annotation workflows and power your model performance with data-driven insights\nTry Encord today\nmedical banner\nNow that we have explored the creation and analysis of embeddings, let's examine a case study to gain a deeper understanding of how embeddings can benefit machine learning models when compared to traditional machine learning algorithms.\n\nCase Study: Embeddings and Object Classification\nThis case study focuses on the effect of embeddings on object classification algorithms. By visualizing the embeddings of the training dataset, we can explore their impact on the process.\n\nImage classification is a popular application of machine learning, and embeddings are effective for this task. Embedding-based approaches to image classification involve learning a lower-dimensional representation of the image data and using this representation as input to a machine learning model.\n\nblog image\n\nExample of dog classification \n\nAnalyzing the embeddings can reduce the need for manual feature engineering. Compared to traditional machine learning algorithms, embedding-based approaches enable more efficient computation. Hence, the trained model will often achieve higher accuracy and better generalization to new, unseen data. Let's visualize the embeddings to understand this better.\n\nVisualizing embeddings\nHere, we will be using the Encord Active platform to visualize the embedding plot of the Caltech-101 dataset. \n\nThe Caltech-101 dataset consists of images of objects categorized into 101 classes. Each image in the dataset has different dimensions, but they are generally of medium resolution, with dimensions ranging from 200 x 200 to 500 x 500 pixels. However, the number of dimensions in the dataset will depend on the number of features used to represent each image. In general, most Caltech-101 image features will have hundreds or thousands of dimensions and it will be helpful to visualize it in lower-dimensional space.\n\nblog image\n\nExample of images presented in Caltech101 dataset\n\nSource\n\nRun the following commands in your favorite Python environment with the following commands will download Encord Active:\n\npython3.9 -m venv ea-venv\nsource ea-venv/bin/activate\n# within venv\npip install encord-active\nOr you can follow through the following command to install Encord Active using GitHub:\n\npip install git+https://github.com/encord-team/encord-active\nTo check if Encord Active has been installed, run:\n\nencord-active --help\nEncord Active has many sandbox datasets like the MNIST, BDD100K, TACO dataset, and much more. Caltech101 dataset is one of them. These sandbox datasets are commonly used in computer vision applications for building benchmark models.\n\nNow that you have Encord Active installed, let\u2019s download the Caltech101 dataset by running the command:\n\nencord-active download\nThe script asks you to choose a project, navigate the options \u2193 and \u2191 select the Caltech-101 train or test dataset, and hit enter. The dataset has been pre-divided into a training set comprising 60% of the data and a testing set comprising the rest 40% of the data for the convenience of analyzing the dataset.\n\nEasy! Now, you got your data. To visualize the data in the browser, run the command:\n\ncd /path/to/downloaded/project\nencord-active visualize\nThe image below shows the webpage that opens in your browser showing the training data and its properties.\n\nblog image\n\nVisualize the data in your browser (data = Caltech-101 training data-60% of Caltech-101 dataset)\n\nThe 2D embedding plot can be found in the Explorer pages of the Data Quality and Label Quality sections.\n\nblog image\n\nThe 2D embedding plot in the Data Quality Explorer page of Encord.\n\nThe 2D embedding plot here is a scatter plot with each point representing a data point in the dataset. The position of each point on the plot reflects the relative similarity or dissimilarity of the data points with respect to each other. For example, select the box or the Lasso Select in the upper right corner of the plot. Once you select a region, you can visualize the images only in the selected region.\n\nblog image\n\nBy projecting the data into two dimensions, you can now see clusters of similar data points, outliers, and other patterns that may be useful for data analysis.\n\nblog image\n\nFor example, we see in the selected cluster, there is one outlier.\n\nThe 2D embedding plot in label quality shows the data points of each image and each color represents the class the object belongs to. This helps in finding out the outliers by spotting the unexpected relationships or possible areas of model bias for object labels. \n\nThis plot also shows the separability of the dataset. A separable dataset is useful for object recognition because it allows for the use of simpler and more efficient computer vision models that can achieve high accuracy with relatively few parameters. \n\nblog image\n\nThe 2D embedding plot in the Label Quality Explorer page of Encord.\n\nA separable dataset is a useful starting point for object classification, as it allows us to quickly develop and evaluate simple machine learning models before exploring more complex models if needed. It also helps us better understand the data and the features that distinguish the different classes of objects, which can be useful for developing more sophisticated models in the future.\n\n\ud83d\udca1Read the detailed analysis of the Caltech101 dataset to understand the dataset better.

It\u2019s essential to carefully consider the data and the task at hand before selecting an embedding technique. It is also important to remember the computational resources required for the embedding technique and the size of the resulting embeddings.\n\nIt\u2019s also important to stay up to date with the latest research and techniques in the field of AI embeddings. This can help ensure that the most effective and efficient embedding techniques are used for creating high-quality training data.\n\nAddressing Data Bias and Ensuring Data Diversity\nUsing a large and diverse dataset for generating embeddings for the training data is a good way to ensure the embeddings address the bias in the dataset. This helps capture the full range of variation in the data and results in more accurate embeddings.\n\nValidating the Embeddings\nAnalyzing the embeddings to validate their quality is a crucial step. The embeddings should be evaluated and validated to ensure that they capture the relevant information and can be used effectively for the task at hand. Visualization of the embeddings in a lower-dimensional space can help identify any patterns or clusters in the data and aid in the validation process.\n\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, AI embeddings are powerful tools for creating high-quality training data in machine learning. By using embeddings, data scientists can improve data quality, reduce the need for manual data labeling, and enable more efficient computation. Best practices for using AI embeddings include:\n\nChoosing appropriate techniques.\nAddressing data bias and ensuring diversity.\nUnderstanding limitations that could impact data quality.\nAI embeddings have a promising future in machine learning, and we recommend implementing them in data creation whenever possible.\n\nFuture Directions\nIn the future, we can expect to see more sophisticated embedding techniques and tools, as well as increased use of embeddings in a wide range of applications beyond image and text classification. For example, Meta AI\u2019s new model ImageBIND is a machine learning model that creates a joint embedding space for multiple modalities, such as images, text, and audio. The model is designed to enable the effective integration of multiple modalities and improve performance on a variety of multi-modal machine learning tasks.\n", "cache_control": {"type": "ephemeral"}}], "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Who is the author of this blog?"}]}

By converting input data into machine-readable formats, businesses can leverage AI technology to transform workflows, streamline processes, and optimize performance.\n\nMachine learning is a powerful tool that has the potential to transform the way we live and work. However, the success of any machine learning model depends heavily on the quality of the training data that is used to develop it. High-quality training data is often considered to be the most critical factor in achieving accurate and reliable machine learning results.\n\nIn this blog, we\u2019ll discuss the importance of high-quality training data in machine learning and how AI embeddings can help improve it. We will cover:\n\nImportance of high-quality training data\nCreating high-quality training data using AI embeddings\nCase studies demonstrating the use of embeddings \nBest practices for using AI embeddings\nLeverage embeddings to analyze and fix your dataset and labels using Encord Active\nLearn more\nmedical banner\nImportance of High-Quality Training Data\nThe importance of high-quality training data in machine learning lies in the fact that it directly impacts the accuracy and reliability of machine learning models. For a model to accurately learn patterns and make predictions, it needs to be trained on large volumes of diverse, accurate, and unbiased data. If the data used for training is low-quality or contains inaccuracies and biases, it will produce less accurate and potentially biased predictions.\n\nThe quality of datasets being used to train models applies to every type of AI model, including Foundation Models, such as ChatGPT and Google\u2019s BERT. The Washington Post took a closer look at the vast datasets being used to train some of the world\u2019s most popular and powerful large language models (LLMs). In particular, the article reviewed the content of Google\u2019s C4 dataset, finding that quality and quantity are equally important, especially when training LLMs.  \n\nIn image recognition tasks, if the training data used to teach the model contains images with inaccurate or incomplete labels, then the model may not be able to recognize or classify similar images in its predictions accurately.\n\nAt the same time, if the training data is biased towards certain groups or demographics, then the model may learn and replicate those biases, leading to unfair or discriminatory treatment of certain groups. For instance, Google, too, succumbed to bias traps in a recent incident where its Vision AI model generated racist outcomes.\n\nblog image\n\nThe images in the BDD dataset have a pedestrian labeled as remote and book, which is clearly annotated wrongly. \n\nHence, using high-quality training data is crucial to ensuring accurate and unbiased machine learning models. This involves selecting appropriate and diverse data sources and ensuring the data is cleaned, preprocessed, and labeled accurately before being used for training.\n\nWhat is an Embedding in Machine Learning?\nIn artificial intelligence, an embedding is a mathematical representation of a set of data points in a lower-dimensional space that captures their underlying relationships and patterns. Embeddings are often used to represent complex data types, such as images, text, or audio, in a way that machine learning algorithms can easily process.\n\nEmbeddings differ from other machine learning techniques in that they are learned through training a model on a large dataset rather than being explicitly defined by a human expert. This allows the model to learn complex patterns and relationships in the data that may be difficult or impossible for a human to identify.\n\nOnce learned, embeddings can be used as features for other machine learning models, such as classifiers or regressors. This allows the model to make predictions or decisions based on the underlying patterns and relationships in the data, rather than just the raw input.\n\n\ud83d\udca1To make things easier, companies like OpenAI also offer services to extract embeddings from your data.

They enable efficient computation and discovery of complex patterns, reduce overfitting, and capture the underlying structure of the data to generalize better on new, unseen data.\n\nHow to Create High-Quality Training Data Using Embeddings\nData Preparation\nThe first step is preparing the data for embedding. The data preparation step is crucial for embedding because the input data's quality determines the resulting embeddings' quality. \n\nThe first step is to collect the data you want to use for training your model. This can include text data, image data, or graph data. Once you have collected the data, you need to clean and preprocess it to remove any noise or irrelevant information. For example, in text data, data cleaning involves:\n\nTokenizing the text into individual words or phrases.\nRemoving stop words.\nCorrecting spelling errors.\nRemoving punctuation marks.\nYou may need to resize or crop images to a uniform size for image data.\n\nIf the data is noisy, unstructured, or contains irrelevant information, the embeddings may not accurately represent the data and may not provide the desired results. Proper data preparation can help improve the quality of embeddings, leading to more accurate and efficient machine learning models. \n\nFor example, the pre-processing step of image data preparation involves removing image duplicates and images that have no information like extremely dark or overly bright images.\n\n\ud83d\udca1Read the blog on data curation and data curation tools to gain more insight on how to choose the right datasets for your computer vision or machine learning model.\nEmbedding using Machine Learning Techniques\nMost machine learning algorithms require numerical data as input. Therefore, you need to convert the data into a numerical format. This can involve creating a bag of words representation for text data, converting images into pixel values, or transforming graph data into a numerical matrix.\n\nOnce you have converted the data into a numerical format, you can embed it using machine learning techniques. The embedding process involves mapping the data from a higher-dimensional space to a lower-dimensional space while preserving its semantic meaning. Some of the popular embedding techniques are:\n\nScale your annotation workflows and power your model performance with data-driven insights\nTry Encord today\nmedical banner\nPrincipal Component Analysis (PCA) & Single Value Decomposition (SVD)\nPrincipal Component Analysis (PCA) is a dimensionality reduction technique that transforms the original data into a set of new, uncorrelated features (called principal components). It captures the most important information in the data while discarding the less important information.\n\nTo perform PCA for embedding, the original data is first centered and scaled to have zero mean and unit variance. Next, the covariance matrix of the centered data is calculated. The eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the covariance matrix are then computed, and the eigenvectors are sorted in descending order based on their corresponding eigenvalues. The top k eigenvectors are then selected to form the new feature space, where k is the desired dimensionality of the embedded space.\n\nblog image\n\nAn example where we transform five data points using PCA. The left graph is our original data; the right graph would be our transformed data. The two charts show the same data, but the right graph reflects the original data transformed so that the axes are now the principal components.\n\nSource\n\nFinally, the original data is projected onto the new feature space using the selected eigenvectors to obtain the embedded representation. PCA is a widely used technique for embedding, particularly for image and audio data, and has been used in a variety of applications such as facial recognition and speech recognition.\n\nSingular Value Decomposition (SVD) is used within PCA, so we will only cover this briefly. SVD decomposes a matrix into three matrices: U, \u03a3, and V. U represents the left singular vectors, S represents the singular values, and V represents the right singular vectors.\n\nblog image\n\nEquation of the SVD theorem.\n\nThe singular values and vectors capture the most important information in the original matrix, allowing for dimensionality reduction and embedding creation. Similar to PCA, SVD can be used to create embeddings for various types of data, including text, images, and graphs.\n\nSVD has been used for various machine learning tasks, such as recommendation systems, text classification, and image processing. It is a powerful technique for creating high-quality embeddings that can improve the performance of machine learning models.\n\nAuto-Encoder\nAutoencoders are neural network models used for unsupervised learning. They consist of an encoder network that maps the input data to a lower-dimensional representation (encoding) and a decoder network that attempts to reconstruct the original input data from the encoding. An autoencoder aims to learn a compressed and meaningful representation of the input data, effectively capturing the essential features.\n\nAutoencoders consist of an encoder neural network that compresses the input data into a lower-dimensional representation or embedding. The decoder network reconstructs the original data from the embedding. By training an eutoencoder on a dataset, the encoder network learns to extract meaningful features and compress the input data into a compact representation. These embeddings can be used for downstream tasks such as clustering, visualization, or transfer learning. \n\nWord2Vec\nWord2Vec is a popular technique for creating word embeddings, which represent words in a high-dimensional vector space. The technique works by training a neural network on a large corpus of text data, to predict the context in which a given word appears. The resulting embeddings capture semantic and syntactic relationships between words, such as similarity and analogy.\n\nWord2Vec is effective in various natural language processing tasks, such as language translation, text classification, and sentiment analysis. It also has applications in recommendation systems and image analysis.\n\nThere are two main approaches to implementing Word2Vec: the Continuous Bag-of-Words (CBOW) model and the Skip-gram model. CBOW predicts a target word given its surrounding context, while Skip-gram predicts the context given a target word. Both models have their advantages and disadvantages, and the choice between them depends on the specific application and the characteristics of the data.\n\nblog image\n\nLeft: CBOW architecture. Right: Skip-gram architecture. The CBOW architecture predicts the current word based on the context, and the Skip-gram predicts surrounding words given the current word.\n\nSource\n\nGloVe\nGloVe, which stands for Global Vectors for Word Representation, is another popular embedding technique that is used to represent words as vectors. Like Word2Vec, GloVe is also a neural network-based approach. However, unlike Word2Vec, which is based on a shallow neural network, GloVe uses a global matrix factorization technique to learn word embeddings.\n\nIn GloVe, the co-occurrence matrix of words is constructed by counting the number of times two words appear together in a given context. The rows of the matrix represent the words, and the columns represent the context in which the words appear. The matrix is then factorized into two separate matrices, one for words and the other for contexts. The product of these two matrices produces the final word embeddings.\n\nblog image\n\nExample of the GloVe embeddings.\n\nSource\n\nGloVe is known to perform well on various NLP tasks such as word analogy, word similarity, and named entity recognition. Additionally, GloVe has also been used for image classification tasks by converting image features into word-like entities and applying GloVe embeddings.\n\nBERT\nBERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a popular language model developed by Google that has been used for a variety of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including embedding. BERT is a deep learning model that uses a transformer architecture to generate word embeddings by taking into account the context of the words. This allows BERT to capture the semantic meaning of words, as well as the relationships between words in a sentence.\n\nblog image\n\nBERT is a pre-trained model that has been trained on massive amounts of text data, making it a powerful tool for generating high-quality word embeddings. BERT-based embeddings are highly effective in a range of NLP tasks, including sentiment analysis, text classification, and question-answering. Additionally, BERT allows for fine-tuning specific downstream tasks, which can lead to even more accurate results.\n\nblog image\n\nOverall pre-training and fine-tuning procedure for BERT\n\nSource\n\nOverall, BERT is a powerful tool for generating high-quality word embeddings that can be used in a wide range of NLP applications. One downside of BERT is that it can be computationally expensive, requiring significant resources for training and inference. However, pre-trained BERT models can be fine-tuned for specific use cases, reducing the need for expensive training.\n\nt-SNE\nt-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) is a widely used dimensionality reduction technique for visualizing high-dimensional data. While t-SNE is primarily used for visualization, it can also be used to generate embeddings. The process involves applying t-SNE to reduce the dimensionality of the data and obtaining a lower-dimensional embedding that captures the inherent structure of the original high-dimensional data.\n\nblog image\n\nSource\n\nt-SNE works by creating a probability distribution that measures the similarity between data points in high-dimensional space and a corresponding probability distribution in the low-dimensional space. It then minimizes the Kullback-Leibler divergence between these distributions to find an embedding that preserves the pairwise similarities between points.\n\nThe resulting embeddings from t-SNE can be used for various purposes such as clustering, anomaly detection, or as input to downstream machine learning algorithms. However, it's important to note that t-SNE is computationally expensive, and the generated embeddings should be interpreted carefully since they emphasize local structure and may not preserve the precise distances between points\n\nUMAP\nUMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) is a dimensionality reduction technique commonly used for generating embeddings. Unlike traditional methods like PCA or t-SNE, UMAP focuses on preserving both local and global structure in the data while maintaining computational efficiency.\n\nblog image\n\nSource\n\nUMAP works by constructing a low-dimensional representation of the data while preserving the neighborhood relationships. It achieves this by modeling the data as a topological structure and approximating the manifold on which the data lies. The algorithm iteratively optimizes a low-dimensional embedding that preserves the pairwise distances between nearby points.\n\nApplying UMAP to a dataset generates embeddings that capture the underlying structure and relationships in the data. These embeddings can be used for various purposes, such as visualization, clustering, or as input to other machine learning algorithms.\n\nUMAP has gained popularity in various domains, including image analysis, genomics, text mining, and recommendation systems, due to its ability to generate high-quality embeddings that preserve both local and global structures while being computationally efficient.\n\nAnalyzing and validating embeddings is an important step in quality assurance to ensure that the generated embeddings accurately represent the underlying data.\n\nScale your annotation workflows and power your model performance with data-driven insights\nTry Encord today\nmedical banner\nAnalyzing and Validating Embeddings for Quality Assurance\nOne common method for analyzing embeddings is to visualize them in a lower-dimensional space, such as 2D or 3D, using techniques like t-SNE or PCA. This can help identify clusters or patterns in the data and provide insights into the quality of the embeddings.\n\nThere are platforms that create and plot the embeddings of the dataset. These plots are helpful when you want to visualize your dataset in the lower-dimensional space. Visualizing the data in this lower-dimensional space makes it easier to identify any potential issues or biases in the data, which can be addressed to improve the quality of the embeddings. Visualizing embeddings can help evaluate and compare different models by providing an intuitive way to assess the quality and usefulness of the embeddings for specific tasks.\n\nOne example is the Encord Active platform, which provides a 2D embedding plot of an image dataset, enabling users to visualize the images within a particular cluster. This simplifies the process of identifying outliers through embeddings. The 2D embedding plot is not only useful in validating the data quality but also the label quality of the dataset.\n\nblog image\n\nA 2D embedding plot of the Rareplanes dataset\n\nValidation of embeddings involves evaluating their performance on downstream tasks, such as classification or prediction, and comparing it with other methods. This can help determine the effectiveness of the embeddings in real-world scenarios and highlight areas for improvement.\n\nAnother aspect of validation is measuring the degree of bias present in the embeddings. This is important because embeddings can reflect biases in the training data, leading to discriminatory or unfair outcomes. Techniques like de-biasing can be used to remove these biases and ensure that the embeddings are fair and unbiased.\n\nvector-try-encord\nScale your annotation workflows and power your model performance with data-driven insights\nTry Encord today\nmedical banner\nNow that we have explored the creation and analysis of embeddings, let's examine a case study to gain a deeper understanding of how embeddings can benefit machine learning models when compared to traditional machine learning algorithms.\n\nCase Study: Embeddings and Object Classification\nThis case study focuses on the effect of embeddings on object classification algorithms. By visualizing the embeddings of the training dataset, we can explore their impact on the process.\n\nImage classification is a popular application of machine learning, and embeddings are effective for this task. Embedding-based approaches to image classification involve learning a lower-dimensional representation of the image data and using this representation as input to a machine learning model.\n\nblog image\n\nExample of dog classification \n\nAnalyzing the embeddings can reduce the need for manual feature engineering. Compared to traditional machine learning algorithms, embedding-based approaches enable more efficient computation. Hence, the trained model will often achieve higher accuracy and better generalization to new, unseen data. Let's visualize the embeddings to understand this better.\n\nVisualizing embeddings\nHere, we will be using the Encord Active platform to visualize the embedding plot of the Caltech-101 dataset. \n\nThe Caltech-101 dataset consists of images of objects categorized into 101 classes. Each image in the dataset has different dimensions, but they are generally of medium resolution, with dimensions ranging from 200 x 200 to 500 x 500 pixels. However, the number of dimensions in the dataset will depend on the number of features used to represent each image. In general, most Caltech-101 image features will have hundreds or thousands of dimensions and it will be helpful to visualize it in lower-dimensional space.\n\nblog image\n\nExample of images presented in Caltech101 dataset\n\nSource\n\nRun the following commands in your favorite Python environment with the following commands will download Encord Active:\n\npython3.9 -m venv ea-venv\nsource ea-venv/bin/activate\n# within venv\npip install encord-active\nOr you can follow through the following command to install Encord Active using GitHub:\n\npip install git+https://github.com/encord-team/encord-active\nTo check if Encord Active has been installed, run:\n\nencord-active --help\nEncord Active has many sandbox datasets like the MNIST, BDD100K, TACO dataset, and much more.

The position of each point on the plot reflects the relative similarity or dissimilarity of the data points with respect to each other. For example, select the box or the Lasso Select in the upper right corner of the plot. Once you select a region, you can visualize the images only in the selected region.\n\nblog image\n\nBy projecting the data into two dimensions, you can now see clusters of similar data points, outliers, and other patterns that may be useful for data analysis.\n\nblog image\n\nFor example, we see in the selected cluster, there is one outlier.\n\nThe 2D embedding plot in label quality shows the data points of each image and each color represents the class the object belongs to. This helps in finding out the outliers by spotting the unexpected relationships or possible areas of model bias for object labels. \n\nThis plot also shows the separability of the dataset. A separable dataset is useful for object recognition because it allows for the use of simpler and more efficient computer vision models that can achieve high accuracy with relatively few parameters. \n\nblog image\n\nThe 2D embedding plot in the Label Quality Explorer page of Encord.\n\nA separable dataset is a useful starting point for object classification, as it allows us to quickly develop and evaluate simple machine learning models before exploring more complex models if needed.

It\u2019s essential to carefully consider the data and the task at hand before selecting an embedding technique. It is also important to remember the computational resources required for the embedding technique and the size of the resulting embeddings.\n\nIt\u2019s also important to stay up to date with the latest research and techniques in the field of AI embeddings. This can help ensure that the most effective and efficient embedding techniques are used for creating high-quality training data.\n\nAddressing Data Bias and Ensuring Data Diversity\nUsing a large and diverse dataset for generating embeddings for the training data is a good way to ensure the embeddings address the bias in the dataset. This helps capture the full range of variation in the data and results in more accurate embeddings.\n\nValidating the Embeddings\nAnalyzing the embeddings to validate their quality is a crucial step. The embeddings should be evaluated and validated to ensure that they capture the relevant information and can be used effectively for the task at hand. Visualization of the embeddings in a lower-dimensional space can help identify any patterns or clusters in the data and aid in the validation process.\n\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, AI embeddings are powerful tools for creating high-quality training data in machine learning. By using embeddings, data scientists can improve data quality, reduce the need for manual data labeling, and enable more efficient computation. Best practices for using AI embeddings include:\n\nChoosing appropriate techniques.\nAddressing data bias and ensuring diversity.\nUnderstanding limitations that could impact data quality.\nAI embeddings have a promising future in machine learning, and we recommend implementing them in data creation whenever possible.\n\nFuture Directions\nIn the future, we can expect to see more sophisticated embedding techniques and tools, as well as increased use of embeddings in a wide range of applications beyond image and text classification. For example, Meta AI\u2019s new model ImageBIND is a machine learning model that creates a joint embedding space for multiple modalities, such as images, text, and audio.

By converting input data into machine-readable formats, businesses can leverage AI technology to transform workflows, streamline processes, and optimize performance.\n\nMachine learning is a powerful tool that has the potential to transform the way we live and work. However, the success of any machine learning model depends heavily on the quality of the training data that is used to develop it. High-quality training data is often considered to be the most critical factor in achieving accurate and reliable machine learning results.\n\nIn this blog, we\u2019ll discuss the importance of high-quality training data in machine learning and how AI embeddings can help improve it. We will cover:\n\nImportance of high-quality training data\nCreating high-quality training data using AI embeddings\nCase studies demonstrating the use of embeddings \nBest practices for using AI embeddings\nLeverage embeddings to analyze and fix your dataset and labels using Encord Active\nLearn more\nmedical banner\nImportance of High-Quality Training Data\nThe importance of high-quality training data in machine learning lies in the fact that it directly impacts the accuracy and reliability of machine learning models. For a model to accurately learn patterns and make predictions, it needs to be trained on large volumes of diverse, accurate, and unbiased data. If the data used for training is low-quality or contains inaccuracies and biases, it will produce less accurate and potentially biased predictions.\n\nThe quality of datasets being used to train models applies to every type of AI model, including Foundation Models, such as ChatGPT and Google\u2019s BERT. The Washington Post took a closer look at the vast datasets being used to train some of the world\u2019s most popular and powerful large language models (LLMs). In particular, the article reviewed the content of Google\u2019s C4 dataset, finding that quality and quantity are equally important, especially when training LLMs.  \n\nIn image recognition tasks, if the training data used to teach the model contains images with inaccurate or incomplete labels, then the model may not be able to recognize or classify similar images in its predictions accurately.\n\nAt the same time, if the training data is biased towards certain groups or demographics, then the model may learn and replicate those biases, leading to unfair or discriminatory treatment of certain groups. For instance, Google, too, succumbed to bias traps in a recent incident where its Vision AI model generated racist outcomes.\n\nblog image\n\nThe images in the BDD dataset have a pedestrian labeled as remote and book, which is clearly annotated wrongly. \n\nHence, using high-quality training data is crucial to ensuring accurate and unbiased machine learning models. This involves selecting appropriate and diverse data sources and ensuring the data is cleaned, preprocessed, and labeled accurately before being used for training.\n\nWhat is an Embedding in Machine Learning?\nIn artificial intelligence, an embedding is a mathematical representation of a set of data points in a lower-dimensional space that captures their underlying relationships and patterns. Embeddings are often used to represent complex data types, such as images, text, or audio, in a way that machine learning algorithms can easily process.\n\nEmbeddings differ from other machine learning techniques in that they are learned through training a model on a large dataset rather than being explicitly defined by a human expert. This allows the model to learn complex patterns and relationships in the data that may be difficult or impossible for a human to identify.\n\nOnce learned, embeddings can be used as features for other machine learning models, such as classifiers or regressors. This allows the model to make predictions or decisions based on the underlying patterns and relationships in the data, rather than just the raw input.\n\n\ud83d\udca1To make things easier, companies like OpenAI also offer services to extract embeddings from your data.

This can save time and resources, especially when dealing with large datasets.\n\nReducing Computation\nEmbeddings are useful in reducing computation by representing high-dimensional data in a lower-dimensional space. For example, a 256 x 256 image contains 65,536 pixels in image processing, resulting in many features if directly used. Using a CNN, the image can be transformed into a 1000-dimensional feature vector, consolidating the information. This compression significantly reduces computational requirements, approximately 65 times less, allowing for more efficient image processing and analysis without sacrificing essential details.\n\nEnhancing Natual Language Processing (NLP)\nWord embeddings are widely used in NLP applications such as sentiment analysis, language translation, and chatbot development. Mapping words to vector representations makes it easier for machine learning algorithms to understand the relationships between words.\n\nblog image\n\nSource\n\nImproving Recommendation Systems\nCollaborative filtering, a type of recommendation system uses user and item embeddings to make personalized recommendations. By embedding user and item data in a vector space, the algorithm, can identify similar items and recommend them to users.\n\nEnhancing Image and Video Processing\nImage and video embeddings can be used for object detection, recognition, and classification. Mapping images and videos to vector representations makes it easier for machine learning algorithms to identify and classify different objects within them.\n\nHence, the applications of AI embeddings are diverse and offer many benefits, including improving data quality and reducing the need for manual data labeling.

They consist of an encoder network that maps the input data to a lower-dimensional representation (encoding) and a decoder network that attempts to reconstruct the original input data from the encoding. An autoencoder aims to learn a compressed and meaningful representation of the input data, effectively capturing the essential features.\n\nAutoencoders consist of an encoder neural network that compresses the input data into a lower-dimensional representation or embedding. The decoder network reconstructs the original data from the embedding. By training an eutoencoder on a dataset, the encoder network learns to extract meaningful features and compress the input data into a compact representation. These embeddings can be used for downstream tasks such as clustering, visualization, or transfer learning. \n\nWord2Vec\nWord2Vec is a popular technique for creating word embeddings, which represent words in a high-dimensional vector space. The technique works by training a neural network on a large corpus of text data, to predict the context in which a given word appears. The resulting embeddings capture semantic and syntactic relationships between words, such as similarity and analogy.\n\nWord2Vec is effective in various natural language processing tasks, such as language translation, text classification, and sentiment analysis. It also has applications in recommendation systems and image analysis.\n\nThere are two main approaches to implementing Word2Vec: the Continuous Bag-of-Words (CBOW) model and the Skip-gram model. CBOW predicts a target word given its surrounding context, while Skip-gram predicts the context given a target word. Both models have their advantages and disadvantages, and the choice between them depends on the specific application and the characteristics of the data.\n\nblog image\n\nLeft: CBOW architecture. Right: Skip-gram architecture. The CBOW architecture predicts the current word based on the context, and the Skip-gram predicts surrounding words given the current word.\n\nSource\n\nGloVe\nGloVe, which stands for Global Vectors for Word Representation, is another popular embedding technique that is used to represent words as vectors. Like Word2Vec, GloVe is also a neural network-based approach. However, unlike Word2Vec, which is based on a shallow neural network, GloVe uses a global matrix factorization technique to learn word embeddings.\n\nIn GloVe, the co-occurrence matrix of words is constructed by counting the number of times two words appear together in a given context. The rows of the matrix represent the words, and the columns represent the context in which the words appear. The matrix is then factorized into two separate matrices, one for words and the other for contexts. The product of these two matrices produces the final word embeddings.\n\nblog image\n\nExample of the GloVe embeddings.\n\nSource\n\nGloVe is known to perform well on various NLP tasks such as word analogy, word similarity, and named entity recognition. Additionally, GloVe has also been used for image classification tasks by converting image features into word-like entities and applying GloVe embeddings.\n\nBERT\nBERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a popular language model developed by Google that has been used for a variety of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including embedding. BERT is a deep learning model that uses a transformer architecture to generate word embeddings by taking into account the context of the words. This allows BERT to capture the semantic meaning of words, as well as the relationships between words in a sentence.\n\nblog image\n\nBERT is a pre-trained model that has been trained on massive amounts of text data, making it a powerful tool for generating high-quality word embeddings. BERT-based embeddings are highly effective in a range of NLP tasks, including sentiment analysis, text classification, and question-answering. Additionally, BERT allows for fine-tuning specific downstream tasks, which can lead to even more accurate results.\n\nblog image\n\nOverall pre-training and fine-tuning procedure for BERT\n\nSource\n\nOverall, BERT is a powerful tool for generating high-quality word embeddings that can be used in a wide range of NLP applications. One downside of BERT is that it can be computationally expensive, requiring significant resources for training and inference. However, pre-trained BERT models can be fine-tuned for specific use cases, reducing the need for expensive training.\n\nt-SNE\nt-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) is a widely used dimensionality reduction technique for visualizing high-dimensional data. While t-SNE is primarily used for visualization, it can also be used to generate embeddings. The process involves applying t-SNE to reduce the dimensionality of the data and obtaining a lower-dimensional embedding that captures the inherent structure of the original high-dimensional data.\n\nblog image\n\nSource\n\nt-SNE works by creating a probability distribution that measures the similarity between data points in high-dimensional space and a corresponding probability distribution in the low-dimensional space. It then minimizes the Kullback-Leibler divergence between these distributions to find an embedding that preserves the pairwise similarities between points.\n\nThe resulting embeddings from t-SNE can be used for various purposes such as clustering, anomaly detection, or as input to downstream machine learning algorithms. However, it's important to note that t-SNE is computationally expensive, and the generated embeddings should be interpreted carefully since they emphasize local structure and may not preserve the precise distances between points\n\nUMAP\nUMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) is a dimensionality reduction technique commonly used for generating embeddings. Unlike traditional methods like PCA or t-SNE, UMAP focuses on preserving both local and global structure in the data while maintaining computational efficiency.\n\nblog image\n\nSource\n\nUMAP works by constructing a low-dimensional representation of the data while preserving the neighborhood relationships. It achieves this by modeling the data as a topological structure and approximating the manifold on which the data lies. The algorithm iteratively optimizes a low-dimensional embedding that preserves the pairwise distances between nearby points.\n\nApplying UMAP to a dataset generates embeddings that capture the underlying structure and relationships in the data. These embeddings can be used for various purposes, such as visualization, clustering, or as input to other machine learning algorithms.\n\nUMAP has gained popularity in various domains, including image analysis, genomics, text mining, and recommendation systems, due to its ability to generate high-quality embeddings that preserve both local and global structures while being computationally efficient.\n\nAnalyzing and validating embeddings is an important step in quality assurance to ensure that the generated embeddings accurately represent the underlying data.\n\nScale your annotation workflows and power your model performance with data-driven insights\nTry Encord today\nmedical banner\nAnalyzing and Validating Embeddings for Quality Assurance\nOne common method for analyzing embeddings is to visualize them in a lower-dimensional space, such as 2D or 3D, using techniques like t-SNE or PCA. This can help identify clusters or patterns in the data and provide insights into the quality of the embeddings.\n\nThere are platforms that create and plot the embeddings of the dataset. These plots are helpful when you want to visualize your dataset in the lower-dimensional space. Visualizing the data in this lower-dimensional space makes it easier to identify any potential issues or biases in the data, which can be addressed to improve the quality of the embeddings. Visualizing embeddings can help evaluate and compare different models by providing an intuitive way to assess the quality and usefulness of the embeddings for specific tasks.\n\nOne example is the Encord Active platform, which provides a 2D embedding plot of an image dataset, enabling users to visualize the images within a particular cluster. This simplifies the process of identifying outliers through embeddings. The 2D embedding plot is not only useful in validating the data quality but also the label quality of the dataset.\n\nblog image\n\nA 2D embedding plot of the Rareplanes dataset\n\nValidation of embeddings involves evaluating their performance on downstream tasks, such as classification or prediction, and comparing it with other methods. This can help determine the effectiveness of the embeddings in real-world scenarios and highlight areas for improvement.\n\nAnother aspect of validation is measuring the degree of bias present in the embeddings. This is important because embeddings can reflect biases in the training data, leading to discriminatory or unfair outcomes. Techniques like de-biasing can be used to remove these biases and ensure that the embeddings are fair and unbiased.\n\nvector-try-encord\nScale your annotation workflows and power your model performance with data-driven insights\nTry Encord today\nmedical banner\nNow that we have explored the creation and analysis of embeddings, let's examine a case study to gain a deeper understanding of how embeddings can benefit machine learning models when compared to traditional machine learning algorithms.\n\nCase Study: Embeddings and Object Classification\nThis case study focuses on the effect of embeddings on object classification algorithms. By visualizing the embeddings of the training dataset, we can explore their impact on the process.\n\nImage classification is a popular application of machine learning, and embeddings are effective for this task. Embedding-based approaches to image classification involve learning a lower-dimensional representation of the image data and using this representation as input to a machine learning model.\n\nblog image\n\nExample of dog classification \n\nAnalyzing the embeddings can reduce the need for manual feature engineering. Compared to traditional machine learning algorithms, embedding-based approaches enable more efficient computation. Hence, the trained model will often achieve higher accuracy and better generalization to new, unseen data. Let's visualize the embeddings to understand this better.\n\nVisualizing embeddings\nHere, we will be using the Encord Active platform to visualize the embedding plot of the Caltech-101 dataset. \n\nThe Caltech-101 dataset consists of images of objects categorized into 101 classes. Each image in the dataset has different dimensions, but they are generally of medium resolution, with dimensions ranging from 200 x 200 to 500 x 500 pixels. However, the number of dimensions in the dataset will depend on the number of features used to represent each image. In general, most Caltech-101 image features will have hundreds or thousands of dimensions and it will be helpful to visualize it in lower-dimensional space.\n\nblog image\n\nExample of images presented in Caltech101 dataset\n\nSource\n\nRun the following commands in your favorite Python environment with the following commands will download Encord Active:\n\npython3.9 -m venv ea-venv\nsource ea-venv/bin/activate\n# within venv\npip install encord-active\nOr you can follow through the following command to install Encord Active using GitHub:\n\npip install git+https://github.com/encord-team/encord-active\nTo check if Encord Active has been installed, run:\n\nencord-active --help\nEncord Active has many sandbox datasets like the MNIST, BDD100K, TACO dataset, and much more.

The position of each point on the plot reflects the relative similarity or dissimilarity of the data points with respect to each other. For example, select the box or the Lasso Select in the upper right corner of the plot. Once you select a region, you can visualize the images only in the selected region.\n\nblog image\n\nBy projecting the data into two dimensions, you can now see clusters of similar data points, outliers, and other patterns that may be useful for data analysis.\n\nblog image\n\nFor example, we see in the selected cluster, there is one outlier.\n\nThe 2D embedding plot in label quality shows the data points of each image and each color represents the class the object belongs to. This helps in finding out the outliers by spotting the unexpected relationships or possible areas of model bias for object labels. \n\nThis plot also shows the separability of the dataset. A separable dataset is useful for object recognition because it allows for the use of simpler and more efficient computer vision models that can achieve high accuracy with relatively few parameters. \n\nblog image\n\nThe 2D embedding plot in the Label Quality Explorer page of Encord.\n\nA separable dataset is a useful starting point for object classification, as it allows us to quickly develop and evaluate simple machine learning models before exploring more complex models if needed.

It\u2019s essential to carefully consider the data and the task at hand before selecting an embedding technique. It is also important to remember the computational resources required for the embedding technique and the size of the resulting embeddings.\n\nIt\u2019s also important to stay up to date with the latest research and techniques in the field of AI embeddings. This can help ensure that the most effective and efficient embedding techniques are used for creating high-quality training data.\n\nAddressing Data Bias and Ensuring Data Diversity\nUsing a large and diverse dataset for generating embeddings for the training data is a good way to ensure the embeddings address the bias in the dataset. This helps capture the full range of variation in the data and results in more accurate embeddings.\n\nValidating the Embeddings\nAnalyzing the embeddings to validate their quality is a crucial step. The embeddings should be evaluated and validated to ensure that they capture the relevant information and can be used effectively for the task at hand. Visualization of the embeddings in a lower-dimensional space can help identify any patterns or clusters in the data and aid in the validation process.\n\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, AI embeddings are powerful tools for creating high-quality training data in machine learning. By using embeddings, data scientists can improve data quality, reduce the need for manual data labeling, and enable more efficient computation. Best practices for using AI embeddings include:\n\nChoosing appropriate techniques.\nAddressing data bias and ensuring diversity.\nUnderstanding limitations that could impact data quality.\nAI embeddings have a promising future in machine learning, and we recommend implementing them in data creation whenever possible.\n\nFuture Directions\nIn the future, we can expect to see more sophisticated embedding techniques and tools, as well as increased use of embeddings in a wide range of applications beyond image and text classification. For example, Meta AI\u2019s new model ImageBIND is a machine learning model that creates a joint embedding space for multiple modalities, such as images, text, and audio.

By converting input data into machine-readable formats, businesses can leverage AI technology to transform workflows, streamline processes, and optimize performance.\n\nMachine learning is a powerful tool that has the potential to transform the way we live and work. However, the success of any machine learning model depends heavily on the quality of the training data that is used to develop it. High-quality training data is often considered to be the most critical factor in achieving accurate and reliable machine learning results.\n\nIn this blog, we\u2019ll discuss the importance of high-quality training data in machine learning and how AI embeddings can help improve it. We will cover:\n\nImportance of high-quality training data\nCreating high-quality training data using AI embeddings\nCase studies demonstrating the use of embeddings \nBest practices for using AI embeddings\nLeverage embeddings to analyze and fix your dataset and labels using Encord Active\nLearn more\nmedical banner\nImportance of High-Quality Training Data\nThe importance of high-quality training data in machine learning lies in the fact that it directly impacts the accuracy and reliability of machine learning models. For a model to accurately learn patterns and make predictions, it needs to be trained on large volumes of diverse, accurate, and unbiased data. If the data used for training is low-quality or contains inaccuracies and biases, it will produce less accurate and potentially biased predictions.\n\nThe quality of datasets being used to train models applies to every type of AI model, including Foundation Models, such as ChatGPT and Google\u2019s BERT. The Washington Post took a closer look at the vast datasets being used to train some of the world\u2019s most popular and powerful large language models (LLMs). In particular, the article reviewed the content of Google\u2019s C4 dataset, finding that quality and quantity are equally important, especially when training LLMs.  \n\nIn image recognition tasks, if the training data used to teach the model contains images with inaccurate or incomplete labels, then the model may not be able to recognize or classify similar images in its predictions accurately.\n\nAt the same time, if the training data is biased towards certain groups or demographics, then the model may learn and replicate those biases, leading to unfair or discriminatory treatment of certain groups. For instance, Google, too, succumbed to bias traps in a recent incident where its Vision AI model generated racist outcomes.\n\nblog image\n\nThe images in the BDD dataset have a pedestrian labeled as remote and book, which is clearly annotated wrongly. \n\nHence, using high-quality training data is crucial to ensuring accurate and unbiased machine learning models. This involves selecting appropriate and diverse data sources and ensuring the data is cleaned, preprocessed, and labeled accurately before being used for training.\n\nWhat is an Embedding in Machine Learning?\nIn artificial intelligence, an embedding is a mathematical representation of a set of data points in a lower-dimensional space that captures their underlying relationships and patterns. Embeddings are often used to represent complex data types, such as images, text, or audio, in a way that machine learning algorithms can easily process.\n\nEmbeddings differ from other machine learning techniques in that they are learned through training a model on a large dataset rather than being explicitly defined by a human expert. This allows the model to learn complex patterns and relationships in the data that may be difficult or impossible for a human to identify.\n\nOnce learned, embeddings can be used as features for other machine learning models, such as classifiers or regressors. This allows the model to make predictions or decisions based on the underlying patterns and relationships in the data, rather than just the raw input.\n\n\ud83d\udca1To make things easier, companies like OpenAI also offer services to extract embeddings from your data. Read to find out more.\nTypes of Embeddings\nSeveral types of embeddings can be used in machine learning, including\n\nImage Embeddings\nImage embeddings are used to represent images in a lower-dimensional space. These embeddings capture the visual features of an image, such as color and texture, allowing machine learning models to perform image classification, object detection, and other computer vision tasks.\n\nblog image\n\nExample of visualization of image embeddings. Here the BDD dataset is visualized in a 2D embedding plot on the Encord platform. \n\nWord Embeddings\nWord embeddings are used to represent words as vectors in a low-dimensional space.

Right: A continuous space embedding of the nodes of the graph using DeepWalk. \n\nBy capturing the essence of the data in a lower-dimensional space, embeddings enable efficient computation and discovery of complex patterns and relationships that might not be otherwise apparent. These benefits enable various applications of AI embeddings, as discussed below.\n\nApplications of Embeddings\nAI embeddings have numerous applications in data creation and machine learning, including\n\nImproving Data Quality\nAI embeddings can help improve data quality by reducing noise, removing outliers, and capturing semantic relationships. This is particularly useful in scenarios where the data needs to be more structured or contain missing values. For example, in natural language processing, word embeddings can represent words with similar meanings closer together, enabling better semantic understanding and enhancing the accuracy of various language-related tasks.\n\n\ud83d\udca1Read 5 ways to improve the quality of the training data.\nReducing the Need for Manual Data Labeling\nAI embeddings can automatically label data based on its embedding representation. This can save time and resources, especially when dealing with large datasets.\n\nReducing Computation\nEmbeddings are useful in reducing computation by representing high-dimensional data in a lower-dimensional space. For example, a 256 x 256 image contains 65,536 pixels in image processing, resulting in many features if directly used. Using a CNN, the image can be transformed into a 1000-dimensional feature vector, consolidating the information. This compression significantly reduces computational requirements, approximately 65 times less, allowing for more efficient image processing and analysis without sacrificing essential details.\n\nEnhancing Natual Language Processing (NLP)\nWord embeddings are widely used in NLP applications such as sentiment analysis, language translation, and chatbot development. Mapping words to vector representations makes it easier for machine learning algorithms to understand the relationships between words.\n\nblog image\n\nSource\n\nImproving Recommendation Systems\nCollaborative filtering, a type of recommendation system uses user and item embeddings to make personalized recommendations. By embedding user and item data in a vector space, the algorithm, can identify similar items and recommend them to users.\n\nEnhancing Image and Video Processing\nImage and video embeddings can be used for object detection, recognition, and classification. Mapping images and videos to vector representations makes it easier for machine learning algorithms to identify and classify different objects within them.\n\nHence, the applications of AI embeddings are diverse and offer many benefits, including improving data quality and reducing the need for manual data labeling.

For example, embeddings can help fill in gaps by leveraging the learned patterns and relationships within the data. \n\nAI models can make informed estimations or predictions for missing values by analyzing the surrounding representations, allowing for more complete and reliable data analysis. This can help improve the accuracy of machine learning models by providing more comprehensive and representative data for training.\n\nblog image\n\nSource\n\nReduce Bias\nUsing AI embeddings in training data can help reduce bias by enabling a more nuanced understanding of the relationships and patterns in the data, allowing for identifying and mitigating potential sources of bias. This can help to ensure that machine learning models are trained on fair and representative data, leading to more accurate and unbiased predictions.\n\n\ud83d\udca1Read to find out five more ways to reduce bias in your training data.\nImprove Model Performance\nAI embeddings offer several benefits such as increased efficiency, better generalization, and enhanced performance in various machine learning tasks. They enable efficient computation and discovery of complex patterns, reduce overfitting, and capture the underlying structure of the data to generalize better on new, unseen data.\n\nHow to Create High-Quality Training Data Using Embeddings\nData Preparation\nThe first step is preparing the data for embedding. The data preparation step is crucial for embedding because the input data's quality determines the resulting embeddings' quality. \n\nThe first step is to collect the data you want to use for training your model. This can include text data, image data, or graph data. Once you have collected the data, you need to clean and preprocess it to remove any noise or irrelevant information. For example, in text data, data cleaning involves:\n\nTokenizing the text into individual words or phrases.\nRemoving stop words.\nCorrecting spelling errors.\nRemoving punctuation marks.\nYou may need to resize or crop images to a uniform size for image data.\n\nIf the data is noisy, unstructured, or contains irrelevant information, the embeddings may not accurately represent the data and may not provide the desired results. Proper data preparation can help improve the quality of embeddings, leading to more accurate and efficient machine learning models. \n\nFor example, the pre-processing step of image data preparation involves removing image duplicates and images that have no information like extremely dark or overly bright images.\n\n\ud83d\udca1Read the blog on data curation and data curation tools to gain more insight on how to choose the right datasets for your computer vision or machine learning model.\nEmbedding using Machine Learning Techniques\nMost machine learning algorithms require numerical data as input. Therefore, you need to convert the data into a numerical format. This can involve creating a bag of words representation for text data, converting images into pixel values, or transforming graph data into a numerical matrix.\n\nOnce you have converted the data into a numerical format, you can embed it using machine learning techniques. The embedding process involves mapping the data from a higher-dimensional space to a lower-dimensional space while preserving its semantic meaning. Some of the popular embedding techniques are:\n\nScale your annotation workflows and power your model performance with data-driven insights\nTry Encord today\nmedical banner\nPrincipal Component Analysis (PCA) & Single Value Decomposition (SVD)\nPrincipal Component Analysis (PCA) is a dimensionality reduction technique that transforms the original data into a set of new, uncorrelated features (called principal components). It captures the most important information in the data while discarding the less important information.\n\nTo perform PCA for embedding, the original data is first centered and scaled to have zero mean and unit variance. Next, the covariance matrix of the centered data is calculated. The eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the covariance matrix are then computed, and the eigenvectors are sorted in descending order based on their corresponding eigenvalues. The top k eigenvectors are then selected to form the new feature space, where k is the desired dimensionality of the embedded space.\n\nblog image\n\nAn example where we transform five data points using PCA. The left graph is our original data; the right graph would be our transformed data. The two charts show the same data, but the right graph reflects the original data transformed so that the axes are now the principal components.\n\nSource\n\nFinally, the original data is projected onto the new feature space using the selected eigenvectors to obtain the embedded representation. PCA is a widely used technique for embedding, particularly for image and audio data, and has been used in a variety of applications such as facial recognition and speech recognition.\n\nSingular Value Decomposition (SVD) is used within PCA, so we will only cover this briefly. SVD decomposes a matrix into three matrices: U, \u03a3, and V. U represents the left singular vectors, S represents the singular values, and V represents the right singular vectors.\n\nblog image\n\nEquation of the SVD theorem.\n\nThe singular values and vectors capture the most important information in the original matrix, allowing for dimensionality reduction and embedding creation. Similar to PCA, SVD can be used to create embeddings for various types of data, including text, images, and graphs.\n\nSVD has been used for various machine learning tasks, such as recommendation systems, text classification, and image processing.

The decoder network reconstructs the original data from the embedding. By training an eutoencoder on a dataset, the encoder network learns to extract meaningful features and compress the input data into a compact representation. These embeddings can be used for downstream tasks such as clustering, visualization, or transfer learning. \n\nWord2Vec\nWord2Vec is a popular technique for creating word embeddings, which represent words in a high-dimensional vector space. The technique works by training a neural network on a large corpus of text data, to predict the context in which a given word appears. The resulting embeddings capture semantic and syntactic relationships between words, such as similarity and analogy.\n\nWord2Vec is effective in various natural language processing tasks, such as language translation, text classification, and sentiment analysis. It also has applications in recommendation systems and image analysis.\n\nThere are two main approaches to implementing Word2Vec: the Continuous Bag-of-Words (CBOW) model and the Skip-gram model. CBOW predicts a target word given its surrounding context, while Skip-gram predicts the context given a target word. Both models have their advantages and disadvantages, and the choice between them depends on the specific application and the characteristics of the data.\n\nblog image\n\nLeft: CBOW architecture. Right: Skip-gram architecture.

One downside of BERT is that it can be computationally expensive, requiring significant resources for training and inference. However, pre-trained BERT models can be fine-tuned for specific use cases, reducing the need for expensive training.\n\nt-SNE\nt-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) is a widely used dimensionality reduction technique for visualizing high-dimensional data. While t-SNE is primarily used for visualization, it can also be used to generate embeddings. The process involves applying t-SNE to reduce the dimensionality of the data and obtaining a lower-dimensional embedding that captures the inherent structure of the original high-dimensional data.\n\nblog image\n\nSource\n\nt-SNE works by creating a probability distribution that measures the similarity between data points in high-dimensional space and a corresponding probability distribution in the low-dimensional space. It then minimizes the Kullback-Leibler divergence between these distributions to find an embedding that preserves the pairwise similarities between points.\n\nThe resulting embeddings from t-SNE can be used for various purposes such as clustering, anomaly detection, or as input to downstream machine learning algorithms. However, it's important to note that t-SNE is computationally expensive, and the generated embeddings should be interpreted carefully since they emphasize local structure and may not preserve the precise distances between points\n\nUMAP\nUMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) is a dimensionality reduction technique commonly used for generating embeddings.

These embeddings can be used for various purposes, such as visualization, clustering, or as input to other machine learning algorithms.\n\nUMAP has gained popularity in various domains, including image analysis, genomics, text mining, and recommendation systems, due to its ability to generate high-quality embeddings that preserve both local and global structures while being computationally efficient.\n\nAnalyzing and validating embeddings is an important step in quality assurance to ensure that the generated embeddings accurately represent the underlying data.\n\nScale your annotation workflows and power your model performance with data-driven insights\nTry Encord today\nmedical banner\nAnalyzing and Validating Embeddings for Quality Assurance\nOne common method for analyzing embeddings is to visualize them in a lower-dimensional space, such as 2D or 3D, using techniques like t-SNE or PCA. This can help identify clusters or patterns in the data and provide insights into the quality of the embeddings.\n\nThere are platforms that create and plot the embeddings of the dataset. These plots are helpful when you want to visualize your dataset in the lower-dimensional space. Visualizing the data in this lower-dimensional space makes it easier to identify any potential issues or biases in the data, which can be addressed to improve the quality of the embeddings. Visualizing embeddings can help evaluate and compare different models by providing an intuitive way to assess the quality and usefulness of the embeddings for specific tasks.\n\nOne example is the Encord Active platform, which provides a 2D embedding plot of an image dataset, enabling users to visualize the images within a particular cluster.

This can help determine the effectiveness of the embeddings in real-world scenarios and highlight areas for improvement.\n\nAnother aspect of validation is measuring the degree of bias present in the embeddings. This is important because embeddings can reflect biases in the training data, leading to discriminatory or unfair outcomes. Techniques like de-biasing can be used to remove these biases and ensure that the embeddings are fair and unbiased.\n\nvector-try-encord\nScale your annotation workflows and power your model performance with data-driven insights\nTry Encord today\nmedical banner\nNow that we have explored the creation and analysis of embeddings, let's examine a case study to gain a deeper understanding of how embeddings can benefit machine learning models when compared to traditional machine learning algorithms.\n\nCase Study: Embeddings and Object Classification\nThis case study focuses on the effect of embeddings on object classification algorithms. By visualizing the embeddings of the training dataset, we can explore their impact on the process.\n\nImage classification is a popular application of machine learning, and embeddings are effective for this task. Embedding-based approaches to image classification involve learning a lower-dimensional representation of the image data and using this representation as input to a machine learning model.\n\nblog image\n\nExample of dog classification \n\nAnalyzing the embeddings can reduce the need for manual feature engineering. Compared to traditional machine learning algorithms, embedding-based approaches enable more efficient computation. Hence, the trained model will often achieve higher accuracy and better generalization to new, unseen data. Let's visualize the embeddings to understand this better.\n\nVisualizing embeddings\nHere, we will be using the Encord Active platform to visualize the embedding plot of the Caltech-101 dataset. \n\nThe Caltech-101 dataset consists of images of objects categorized into 101 classes. Each image in the dataset has different dimensions, but they are generally of medium resolution, with dimensions ranging from 200 x 200 to 500 x 500 pixels. However, the number of dimensions in the dataset will depend on the number of features used to represent each image. In general, most Caltech-101 image features will have hundreds or thousands of dimensions and it will be helpful to visualize it in lower-dimensional space.\n\nblog image\n\nExample of images presented in Caltech101 dataset\n\nSource\n\nRun the following commands in your favorite Python environment with the following commands will download Encord Active:\n\npython3.9 -m venv ea-venv\nsource ea-venv/bin/activate\n# within venv\npip install encord-active\nOr you can follow through the following command to install Encord Active using GitHub:\n\npip install git+https://github.com/encord-team/encord-active\nTo check if Encord Active has been installed, run:\n\nencord-active --help\nEncord Active has many sandbox datasets like the MNIST, BDD100K, TACO dataset, and much more.

The position of each point on the plot reflects the relative similarity or dissimilarity of the data points with respect to each other. For example, select the box or the Lasso Select in the upper right corner of the plot. Once you select a region, you can visualize the images only in the selected region.\n\nblog image\n\nBy projecting the data into two dimensions, you can now see clusters of similar data points, outliers, and other patterns that may be useful for data analysis.\n\nblog image\n\nFor example, we see in the selected cluster, there is one outlier.\n\nThe 2D embedding plot in label quality shows the data points of each image and each color represents the class the object belongs to.

This can help ensure that the most effective and efficient embedding techniques are used for creating high-quality training data.\n\nAddressing Data Bias and Ensuring Data Diversity\nUsing a large and diverse dataset for generating embeddings for the training data is a good way to ensure the embeddings address the bias in the dataset. This helps capture the full range of variation in the data and results in more accurate embeddings.\n\nValidating the Embeddings\nAnalyzing the embeddings to validate their quality is a crucial step. The embeddings should be evaluated and validated to ensure that they capture the relevant information and can be used effectively for the task at hand. Visualization of the embeddings in a lower-dimensional space can help identify any patterns or clusters in the data and aid in the validation process.\n\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, AI embeddings are powerful tools for creating high-quality training data in machine learning.

By converting input data into machine-readable formats, businesses can leverage AI technology to transform workflows, streamline processes, and optimize performance.\n\nMachine learning is a powerful tool that has the potential to transform the way we live and work. However, the success of any machine learning model depends heavily on the quality of the training data that is used to develop it. High-quality training data is often considered to be the most critical factor in achieving accurate and reliable machine learning results.\n\nIn this blog, we\u2019ll discuss the importance of high-quality training data in machine learning and how AI embeddings can help improve it. We will cover:\n\nImportance of high-quality training data\nCreating high-quality training data using AI embeddings\nCase studies demonstrating the use of embeddings \nBest practices for using AI embeddings\nLeverage embeddings to analyze and fix your dataset and labels using Encord Active\nLearn more\nmedical banner\nImportance of High-Quality Training Data\nThe importance of high-quality training data in machine learning lies in the fact that it directly impacts the accuracy and reliability of machine learning models. For a model to accurately learn patterns and make predictions, it needs to be trained on large volumes of diverse, accurate, and unbiased data. If the data used for training is low-quality or contains inaccuracies and biases, it will produce less accurate and potentially biased predictions.\n\nThe quality of datasets being used to train models applies to every type of AI model, including Foundation Models, such as ChatGPT and Google\u2019s BERT. The Washington Post took a closer look at the vast datasets being used to train some of the world\u2019s most popular and powerful large language models (LLMs). In particular, the article reviewed the content of Google\u2019s C4 dataset, finding that quality and quantity are equally important, especially when training LLMs.  \n\nIn image recognition tasks, if the training data used to teach the model contains images with inaccurate or incomplete labels, then the model may not be able to recognize or classify similar images in its predictions accurately.\n\nAt the same time, if the training data is biased towards certain groups or demographics, then the model may learn and replicate those biases, leading to unfair or discriminatory treatment of certain groups. For instance, Google, too, succumbed to bias traps in a recent incident where its Vision AI model generated racist outcomes.\n\nblog image\n\nThe images in the BDD dataset have a pedestrian labeled as remote and book, which is clearly annotated wrongly. \n\nHence, using high-quality training data is crucial to ensuring accurate and unbiased machine learning models. This involves selecting appropriate and diverse data sources and ensuring the data is cleaned, preprocessed, and labeled accurately before being used for training.\n\nWhat is an Embedding in Machine Learning?\nIn artificial intelligence, an embedding is a mathematical representation of a set of data points in a lower-dimensional space that captures their underlying relationships and patterns. Embeddings are often used to represent complex data types, such as images, text, or audio, in a way that machine learning algorithms can easily process.\n\nEmbeddings differ from other machine learning techniques in that they are learned through training a model on a large dataset rather than being explicitly defined by a human expert. This allows the model to learn complex patterns and relationships in the data that may be difficult or impossible for a human to identify.\n\nOnce learned, embeddings can be used as features for other machine learning models, such as classifiers or regressors. This allows the model to make predictions or decisions based on the underlying patterns and relationships in the data, rather than just the raw input.\n\n\ud83d\udca1To make things easier, companies like OpenAI also offer services to extract embeddings from your data. Read to find out more.\nTypes of Embeddings\nSeveral types of embeddings can be used in machine learning, including\n\nImage Embeddings\nImage embeddings are used to represent images in a lower-dimensional space. These embeddings capture the visual features of an image, such as color and texture, allowing machine learning models to perform image classification, object detection, and other computer vision tasks.\n\nblog image\n\nExample of visualization of image embeddings. Here the BDD dataset is visualized in a 2D embedding plot on the Encord platform. \n\nWord Embeddings\nWord embeddings are used to represent words as vectors in a low-dimensional space. These embeddings capture the meaning and relationships between words, allowing machine learning models to better understand and process natural language.\n\nblog image\n\nExample of visualization of word embeddings. \n\nSource\n\nGraph Embeddings\nGraph embeddings are used to represent graphs, which are networks of interconnected nodes, as vectors in a low-dimensional space. These embeddings capture the relationships between nodes in a graph, allowing machine learning models to perform node classification and link prediction tasks.\n\nblog image\n\nLeft: The well-known Karate graph representing a social network. Right: A continuous space embedding of the nodes of the graph using DeepWalk. \n\nBy capturing the essence of the data in a lower-dimensional space, embeddings enable efficient computation and discovery of complex patterns and relationships that might not be otherwise apparent. These benefits enable various applications of AI embeddings, as discussed below.\n\nApplications of Embeddings\nAI embeddings have numerous applications in data creation and machine learning, including\n\nImproving Data Quality\nAI embeddings can help improve data quality by reducing noise, removing outliers, and capturing semantic relationships. This is particularly useful in scenarios where the data needs to be more structured or contain missing values. For example, in natural language processing, word embeddings can represent words with similar meanings closer together, enabling better semantic understanding and enhancing the accuracy of various language-related tasks.\n\n\ud83d\udca1Read 5 ways to improve the quality of the training data.\nReducing the Need for Manual Data Labeling\nAI embeddings can automatically label data based on its embedding representation. This can save time and resources, especially when dealing with large datasets.\n\nReducing Computation\nEmbeddings are useful in reducing computation by representing high-dimensional data in a lower-dimensional space. For example, a 256 x 256 image contains 65,536 pixels in image processing, resulting in many features if directly used. Using a CNN, the image can be transformed into a 1000-dimensional feature vector, consolidating the information. This compression significantly reduces computational requirements, approximately 65 times less, allowing for more efficient image processing and analysis without sacrificing essential details.\n\nEnhancing Natual Language Processing (NLP)\nWord embeddings are widely used in NLP applications such as sentiment analysis, language translation, and chatbot development. Mapping words to vector representations makes it easier for machine learning algorithms to understand the relationships between words.\n\nblog image\n\nSource\n\nImproving Recommendation Systems\nCollaborative filtering, a type of recommendation system uses user and item embeddings to make personalized recommendations. By embedding user and item data in a vector space, the algorithm, can identify similar items and recommend them to users.\n\nEnhancing Image and Video Processing\nImage and video embeddings can be used for object detection, recognition, and classification. Mapping images and videos to vector representations makes it easier for machine learning algorithms to identify and classify different objects within them.\n\nHence, the applications of AI embeddings are diverse and offer many benefits, including improving data quality and reducing the need for manual data labeling. Now, let's delve into how this can be beneficial when utilizing AI embeddings for generating high-quality training data.\n\nFrom scaling to enhancing your model development with data-driven insights\nLearn more\nmedical banner\nBenefits of Embeddings in Data Creation\nHere are a few of the benefits of using embeddings in data creation:\n\nCreate a Larger and Diverse Dataset\nBy automatically identifying patterns and relationships within data, embeddings can help to fill in gaps and identify outliers that might be missed by manual labeling. For example, embeddings can help fill in gaps by leveraging the learned patterns and relationships within the data. \n\nAI models can make informed estimations or predictions for missing values by analyzing the surrounding representations, allowing for more complete and reliable data analysis. This can help improve the accuracy of machine learning models by providing more comprehensive and representative data for training.\n\nblog image\n\nSource\n\nReduce Bias\nUsing AI embeddings in training data can help reduce bias by enabling a more nuanced understanding of the relationships and patterns in the data, allowing for identifying and mitigating potential sources of bias. This can help to ensure that machine learning models are trained on fair and representative data, leading to more accurate and unbiased predictions.\n\n\ud83d\udca1Read to find out five more ways to reduce bias in your training data.\nImprove Model Performance\nAI embeddings offer several benefits such as increased efficiency, better generalization, and enhanced performance in various machine learning tasks. They enable efficient computation and discovery of complex patterns, reduce overfitting, and capture the underlying structure of the data to generalize better on new, unseen data.\n\nHow to Create High-Quality Training Data Using Embeddings\nData Preparation\nThe first step is preparing the data for embedding. The data preparation step is crucial for embedding because the input data's quality determines the resulting embeddings' quality. \n\nThe first step is to collect the data you want to use for training your model. This can include text data, image data, or graph data. Once you have collected the data, you need to clean and preprocess it to remove any noise or irrelevant information. For example, in text data, data cleaning involves:\n\nTokenizing the text into individual words or phrases.\nRemoving stop words.\nCorrecting spelling errors.\nRemoving punctuation marks.\nYou may need to resize or crop images to a uniform size for image data.\n\nIf the data is noisy, unstructured, or contains irrelevant information, the embeddings may not accurately represent the data and may not provide the desired results. Proper data preparation can help improve the quality of embeddings, leading to more accurate and efficient machine learning models. \n\nFor example, the pre-processing step of image data preparation involves removing image duplicates and images that have no information like extremely dark or overly bright images.\n\n\ud83d\udca1Read the blog on data curation and data curation tools to gain more insight on how to choose the right datasets for your computer vision or machine learning model.\nEmbedding using Machine Learning Techniques\nMost machine learning algorithms require numerical data as input. Therefore, you need to convert the data into a numerical format. This can involve creating a bag of words representation for text data, converting images into pixel values, or transforming graph data into a numerical matrix.\n\nOnce you have converted the data into a numerical format, you can embed it using machine learning techniques. The embedding process involves mapping the data from a higher-dimensional space to a lower-dimensional space while preserving its semantic meaning. Some of the popular embedding techniques are:\n\nScale your annotation workflows and power your model performance with data-driven insights\nTry Encord today\nmedical banner\nPrincipal Component Analysis (PCA) & Single Value Decomposition (SVD)\nPrincipal Component Analysis (PCA) is a dimensionality reduction technique that transforms the original data into a set of new, uncorrelated features (called principal components). It captures the most important information in the data while discarding the less important information.\n\nTo perform PCA for embedding, the original data is first centered and scaled to have zero mean and unit variance. Next, the covariance matrix of the centered data is calculated. The eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the covariance matrix are then computed, and the eigenvectors are sorted in descending order based on their corresponding eigenvalues. The top k eigenvectors are then selected to form the new feature space, where k is the desired dimensionality of the embedded space.\n\nblog image\n\nAn example where we transform five data points using PCA. The left graph is our original data; the right graph would be our transformed data. The two charts show the same data, but the right graph reflects the original data transformed so that the axes are now the principal components.\n\nSource\n\nFinally, the original data is projected onto the new feature space using the selected eigenvectors to obtain the embedded representation. PCA is a widely used technique for embedding, particularly for image and audio data, and has been used in a variety of applications such as facial recognition and speech recognition.\n\nSingular Value Decomposition (SVD) is used within PCA, so we will only cover this briefly. SVD decomposes a matrix into three matrices: U, \u03a3, and V. U represents the left singular vectors, S represents the singular values, and V represents the right singular vectors.\n\nblog image\n\nEquation of the SVD theorem.\n\nThe singular values and vectors capture the most important information in the original matrix, allowing for dimensionality reduction and embedding creation. Similar to PCA, SVD can be used to create embeddings for various types of data, including text, images, and graphs.\n\nSVD has been used for various machine learning tasks, such as recommendation systems, text classification, and image processing. It is a powerful technique for creating high-quality embeddings that can improve the performance of machine learning models.\n\nAuto-Encoder\nAutoencoders are neural network models used for unsupervised learning. They consist of an encoder network that maps the input data to a lower-dimensional representation (encoding) and a decoder network that attempts to reconstruct the original input data from the encoding. An autoencoder aims to learn a compressed and meaningful representation of the input data, effectively capturing the essential features.\n\nAutoencoders consist of an encoder neural network that compresses the input data into a lower-dimensional representation or embedding. The decoder network reconstructs the original data from the embedding. By training an eutoencoder on a dataset, the encoder network learns to extract meaningful features and compress the input data into a compact representation. These embeddings can be used for downstream tasks such as clustering, visualization, or transfer learning. \n\nWord2Vec\nWord2Vec is a popular technique for creating word embeddings, which represent words in a high-dimensional vector space. The technique works by training a neural network on a large corpus of text data, to predict the context in which a given word appears. The resulting embeddings capture semantic and syntactic relationships between words, such as similarity and analogy.\n\nWord2Vec is effective in various natural language processing tasks, such as language translation, text classification, and sentiment analysis. It also has applications in recommendation systems and image analysis.\n\nThere are two main approaches to implementing Word2Vec: the Continuous Bag-of-Words (CBOW) model and the Skip-gram model. CBOW predicts a target word given its surrounding context, while Skip-gram predicts the context given a target word. Both models have their advantages and disadvantages, and the choice between them depends on the specific application and the characteristics of the data.\n\nblog image\n\nLeft: CBOW architecture. Right: Skip-gram architecture. The CBOW architecture predicts the current word based on the context, and the Skip-gram predicts surrounding words given the current word.\n\nSource\n\nGloVe\nGloVe, which stands for Global Vectors for Word Representation, is another popular embedding technique that is used to represent words as vectors. Like Word2Vec, GloVe is also a neural network-based approach. However, unlike Word2Vec, which is based on a shallow neural network, GloVe uses a global matrix factorization technique to learn word embeddings.\n\nIn GloVe, the co-occurrence matrix of words is constructed by counting the number of times two words appear together in a given context. The rows of the matrix represent the words, and the columns represent the context in which the words appear. The matrix is then factorized into two separate matrices, one for words and the other for contexts. The product of these two matrices produces the final word embeddings.\n\nblog image\n\nExample of the GloVe embeddings.\n\nSource\n\nGloVe is known to perform well on various NLP tasks such as word analogy, word similarity, and named entity recognition. Additionally, GloVe has also been used for image classification tasks by converting image features into word-like entities and applying GloVe embeddings.\n\nBERT\nBERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a popular language model developed by Google that has been used for a variety of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including embedding. BERT is a deep learning model that uses a transformer architecture to generate word embeddings by taking into account the context of the words. This allows BERT to capture the semantic meaning of words, as well as the relationships between words in a sentence.\n\nblog image\n\nBERT is a pre-trained model that has been trained on massive amounts of text data, making it a powerful tool for generating high-quality word embeddings. BERT-based embeddings are highly effective in a range of NLP tasks, including sentiment analysis, text classification, and question-answering. Additionally, BERT allows for fine-tuning specific downstream tasks, which can lead to even more accurate results.\n\nblog image\n\nOverall pre-training and fine-tuning procedure for BERT\n\nSource\n\nOverall, BERT is a powerful tool for generating high-quality word embeddings that can be used in a wide range of NLP applications. One downside of BERT is that it can be computationally expensive, requiring significant resources for training and inference. However, pre-trained BERT models can be fine-tuned for specific use cases, reducing the need for expensive training.\n\nt-SNE\nt-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) is a widely used dimensionality reduction technique for visualizing high-dimensional data. While t-SNE is primarily used for visualization, it can also be used to generate embeddings. The process involves applying t-SNE to reduce the dimensionality of the data and obtaining a lower-dimensional embedding that captures the inherent structure of the original high-dimensional data.\n\nblog image\n\nSource\n\nt-SNE works by creating a probability distribution that measures the similarity between data points in high-dimensional space and a corresponding probability distribution in the low-dimensional space. It then minimizes the Kullback-Leibler divergence between these distributions to find an embedding that preserves the pairwise similarities between points.\n\nThe resulting embeddings from t-SNE can be used for various purposes such as clustering, anomaly detection, or as input to downstream machine learning algorithms. However, it's important to note that t-SNE is computationally expensive, and the generated embeddings should be interpreted carefully since they emphasize local structure and may not preserve the precise distances between points\n\nUMAP\nUMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) is a dimensionality reduction technique commonly used for generating embeddings. Unlike traditional methods like PCA or t-SNE, UMAP focuses on preserving both local and global structure in the data while maintaining computational efficiency.\n\nblog image\n\nSource\n\nUMAP works by constructing a low-dimensional representation of the data while preserving the neighborhood relationships. It achieves this by modeling the data as a topological structure and approximating the manifold on which the data lies. The algorithm iteratively optimizes a low-dimensional embedding that preserves the pairwise distances between nearby points.\n\nApplying UMAP to a dataset generates embeddings that capture the underlying structure and relationships in the data. These embeddings can be used for various purposes, such as visualization, clustering, or as input to other machine learning algorithms.\n\nUMAP has gained popularity in various domains, including image analysis, genomics, text mining, and recommendation systems, due to its ability to generate high-quality embeddings that preserve both local and global structures while being computationally efficient.\n\nAnalyzing and validating embeddings is an important step in quality assurance to ensure that the generated embeddings accurately represent the underlying data.\n\nScale your annotation workflows and power your model performance with data-driven insights\nTry Encord today\nmedical banner\nAnalyzing and Validating Embeddings for Quality Assurance\nOne common method for analyzing embeddings is to visualize them in a lower-dimensional space, such as 2D or 3D, using techniques like t-SNE or PCA. This can help identify clusters or patterns in the data and provide insights into the quality of the embeddings.\n\nThere are platforms that create and plot the embeddings of the dataset. These plots are helpful when you want to visualize your dataset in the lower-dimensional space. Visualizing the data in this lower-dimensional space makes it easier to identify any potential issues or biases in the data, which can be addressed to improve the quality of the embeddings. Visualizing embeddings can help evaluate and compare different models by providing an intuitive way to assess the quality and usefulness of the embeddings for specific tasks.\n\nOne example is the Encord Active platform, which provides a 2D embedding plot of an image dataset, enabling users to visualize the images within a particular cluster. This simplifies the process of identifying outliers through embeddings. The 2D embedding plot is not only useful in validating the data quality but also the label quality of the dataset.\n\nblog image\n\nA 2D embedding plot of the Rareplanes dataset\n\nValidation of embeddings involves evaluating their performance on downstream tasks, such as classification or prediction, and comparing it with other methods. This can help determine the effectiveness of the embeddings in real-world scenarios and highlight areas for improvement.\n\nAnother aspect of validation is measuring the degree of bias present in the embeddings. This is important because embeddings can reflect biases in the training data, leading to discriminatory or unfair outcomes. Techniques like de-biasing can be used to remove these biases and ensure that the embeddings are fair and unbiased.\n\nvector-try-encord\nScale your annotation workflows and power your model performance with data-driven insights\nTry Encord today\nmedical banner\nNow that we have explored the creation and analysis of embeddings, let's examine a case study to gain a deeper understanding of how embeddings can benefit machine learning models when compared to traditional machine learning algorithms.\n\nCase Study: Embeddings and Object Classification\nThis case study focuses on the effect of embeddings on object classification algorithms.

Let's visualize the embeddings to understand this better.\n\nVisualizing embeddings\nHere, we will be using the Encord Active platform to visualize the embedding plot of the Caltech-101 dataset. \n\nThe Caltech-101 dataset consists of images of objects categorized into 101 classes. Each image in the dataset has different dimensions, but they are generally of medium resolution, with dimensions ranging from 200 x 200 to 500 x 500 pixels. However, the number of dimensions in the dataset will depend on the number of features used to represent each image. In general, most Caltech-101 image features will have hundreds or thousands of dimensions and it will be helpful to visualize it in lower-dimensional space.\n\nblog image\n\nExample of images presented in Caltech101 dataset\n\nSource\n\nRun the following commands in your favorite Python environment with the following commands will download Encord Active:\n\npython3.9 -m venv ea-venv\nsource ea-venv/bin/activate\n# within venv\npip install encord-active\nOr you can follow through the following command to install Encord Active using GitHub:\n\npip install git+https://github.com/encord-team/encord-active\nTo check if Encord Active has been installed, run:\n\nencord-active --help\nEncord Active has many sandbox datasets like the MNIST, BDD100K, TACO dataset, and much more.

It\u2019s essential to carefully consider the data and the task at hand before selecting an embedding technique. It is also important to remember the computational resources required for the embedding technique and the size of the resulting embeddings.\n\nIt\u2019s also important to stay up to date with the latest research and techniques in the field of AI embeddings. This can help ensure that the most effective and efficient embedding techniques are used for creating high-quality training data.\n\nAddressing Data Bias and Ensuring Data Diversity\nUsing a large and diverse dataset for generating embeddings for the training data is a good way to ensure the embeddings address the bias in the dataset. This helps capture the full range of variation in the data and results in more accurate embeddings.\n\nValidating the Embeddings\nAnalyzing the embeddings to validate their quality is a crucial step. The embeddings should be evaluated and validated to ensure that they capture the relevant information and can be used effectively for the task at hand. Visualization of the embeddings in a lower-dimensional space can help identify any patterns or clusters in the data and aid in the validation process.\n\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, AI embeddings are powerful tools for creating high-quality training data in machine learning.

By converting input data into machine-readable formats, businesses can leverage AI technology to transform workflows, streamline processes, and optimize performance.\n\nMachine learning is a powerful tool that has the potential to transform the way we live and work. However, the success of any machine learning model depends heavily on the quality of the training data that is used to develop it. High-quality training data is often considered to be the most critical factor in achieving accurate and reliable machine learning results.\n\nIn this blog, we\u2019ll discuss the importance of high-quality training data in machine learning and how AI embeddings can help improve it. We will cover:\n\nImportance of high-quality training data\nCreating high-quality training data using AI embeddings\nCase studies demonstrating the use of embeddings \nBest practices for using AI embeddings\nLeverage embeddings to analyze and fix your dataset and labels using Encord Active\nLearn more\nmedical banner\nImportance of High-Quality Training Data\nThe importance of high-quality training data in machine learning lies in the fact that it directly impacts the accuracy and reliability of machine learning models. For a model to accurately learn patterns and make predictions, it needs to be trained on large volumes of diverse, accurate, and unbiased data. If the data used for training is low-quality or contains inaccuracies and biases, it will produce less accurate and potentially biased predictions.\n\nThe quality of datasets being used to train models applies to every type of AI model, including Foundation Models, such as ChatGPT and Google\u2019s BERT. The Washington Post took a closer look at the vast datasets being used to train some of the world\u2019s most popular and powerful large language models (LLMs). In particular, the article reviewed the content of Google\u2019s C4 dataset, finding that quality and quantity are equally important, especially when training LLMs.  \n\nIn image recognition tasks, if the training data used to teach the model contains images with inaccurate or incomplete labels, then the model may not be able to recognize or classify similar images in its predictions accurately.\n\nAt the same time, if the training data is biased towards certain groups or demographics, then the model may learn and replicate those biases, leading to unfair or discriminatory treatment of certain groups. For instance, Google, too, succumbed to bias traps in a recent incident where its Vision AI model generated racist outcomes.\n\nblog image\n\nThe images in the BDD dataset have a pedestrian labeled as remote and book, which is clearly annotated wrongly. \n\nHence, using high-quality training data is crucial to ensuring accurate and unbiased machine learning models. This involves selecting appropriate and diverse data sources and ensuring the data is cleaned, preprocessed, and labeled accurately before being used for training.\n\nWhat is an Embedding in Machine Learning?\nIn artificial intelligence, an embedding is a mathematical representation of a set of data points in a lower-dimensional space that captures their underlying relationships and patterns. Embeddings are often used to represent complex data types, such as images, text, or audio, in a way that machine learning algorithms can easily process.\n\nEmbeddings differ from other machine learning techniques in that they are learned through training a model on a large dataset rather than being explicitly defined by a human expert. This allows the model to learn complex patterns and relationships in the data that may be difficult or impossible for a human to identify.\n\nOnce learned, embeddings can be used as features for other machine learning models, such as classifiers or regressors. This allows the model to make predictions or decisions based on the underlying patterns and relationships in the data, rather than just the raw input.\n\n\ud83d\udca1To make things easier, companies like OpenAI also offer services to extract embeddings from your data. Read to find out more.\nTypes of Embeddings\nSeveral types of embeddings can be used in machine learning, including\n\nImage Embeddings\nImage embeddings are used to represent images in a lower-dimensional space. These embeddings capture the visual features of an image, such as color and texture, allowing machine learning models to perform image classification, object detection, and other computer vision tasks.\n\nblog image\n\nExample of visualization of image embeddings. Here the BDD dataset is visualized in a 2D embedding plot on the Encord platform. \n\nWord Embeddings\nWord embeddings are used to represent words as vectors in a low-dimensional space. These embeddings capture the meaning and relationships between words, allowing machine learning models to better understand and process natural language.\n\nblog image\n\nExample of visualization of word embeddings. \n\nSource\n\nGraph Embeddings\nGraph embeddings are used to represent graphs, which are networks of interconnected nodes, as vectors in a low-dimensional space. These embeddings capture the relationships between nodes in a graph, allowing machine learning models to perform node classification and link prediction tasks.\n\nblog image\n\nLeft: The well-known Karate graph representing a social network. Right: A continuous space embedding of the nodes of the graph using DeepWalk. \n\nBy capturing the essence of the data in a lower-dimensional space, embeddings enable efficient computation and discovery of complex patterns and relationships that might not be otherwise apparent. These benefits enable various applications of AI embeddings, as discussed below.\n\nApplications of Embeddings\nAI embeddings have numerous applications in data creation and machine learning, including\n\nImproving Data Quality\nAI embeddings can help improve data quality by reducing noise, removing outliers, and capturing semantic relationships. This is particularly useful in scenarios where the data needs to be more structured or contain missing values. For example, in natural language processing, word embeddings can represent words with similar meanings closer together, enabling better semantic understanding and enhancing the accuracy of various language-related tasks.\n\n\ud83d\udca1Read 5 ways to improve the quality of the training data.\nReducing the Need for Manual Data Labeling\nAI embeddings can automatically label data based on its embedding representation. This can save time and resources, especially when dealing with large datasets.\n\nReducing Computation\nEmbeddings are useful in reducing computation by representing high-dimensional data in a lower-dimensional space. For example, a 256 x 256 image contains 65,536 pixels in image processing, resulting in many features if directly used. Using a CNN, the image can be transformed into a 1000-dimensional feature vector, consolidating the information. This compression significantly reduces computational requirements, approximately 65 times less, allowing for more efficient image processing and analysis without sacrificing essential details.\n\nEnhancing Natual Language Processing (NLP)\nWord embeddings are widely used in NLP applications such as sentiment analysis, language translation, and chatbot development. Mapping words to vector representations makes it easier for machine learning algorithms to understand the relationships between words.\n\nblog image\n\nSource\n\nImproving Recommendation Systems\nCollaborative filtering, a type of recommendation system uses user and item embeddings to make personalized recommendations. By embedding user and item data in a vector space, the algorithm, can identify similar items and recommend them to users.\n\nEnhancing Image and Video Processing\nImage and video embeddings can be used for object detection, recognition, and classification. Mapping images and videos to vector representations makes it easier for machine learning algorithms to identify and classify different objects within them.\n\nHence, the applications of AI embeddings are diverse and offer many benefits, including improving data quality and reducing the need for manual data labeling. Now, let's delve into how this can be beneficial when utilizing AI embeddings for generating high-quality training data.\n\nFrom scaling to enhancing your model development with data-driven insights\nLearn more\nmedical banner\nBenefits of Embeddings in Data Creation\nHere are a few of the benefits of using embeddings in data creation:\n\nCreate a Larger and Diverse Dataset\nBy automatically identifying patterns and relationships within data, embeddings can help to fill in gaps and identify outliers that might be missed by manual labeling. For example, embeddings can help fill in gaps by leveraging the learned patterns and relationships within the data. \n\nAI models can make informed estimations or predictions for missing values by analyzing the surrounding representations, allowing for more complete and reliable data analysis. This can help improve the accuracy of machine learning models by providing more comprehensive and representative data for training.\n\nblog image\n\nSource\n\nReduce Bias\nUsing AI embeddings in training data can help reduce bias by enabling a more nuanced understanding of the relationships and patterns in the data, allowing for identifying and mitigating potential sources of bias. This can help to ensure that machine learning models are trained on fair and representative data, leading to more accurate and unbiased predictions.\n\n\ud83d\udca1Read to find out five more ways to reduce bias in your training data.\nImprove Model Performance\nAI embeddings offer several benefits such as increased efficiency, better generalization, and enhanced performance in various machine learning tasks. They enable efficient computation and discovery of complex patterns, reduce overfitting, and capture the underlying structure of the data to generalize better on new, unseen data.\n\nHow to Create High-Quality Training Data Using Embeddings\nData Preparation\nThe first step is preparing the data for embedding. The data preparation step is crucial for embedding because the input data's quality determines the resulting embeddings' quality. \n\nThe first step is to collect the data you want to use for training your model. This can include text data, image data, or graph data. Once you have collected the data, you need to clean and preprocess it to remove any noise or irrelevant information. For example, in text data, data cleaning involves:\n\nTokenizing the text into individual words or phrases.\nRemoving stop words.\nCorrecting spelling errors.\nRemoving punctuation marks.\nYou may need to resize or crop images to a uniform size for image data.\n\nIf the data is noisy, unstructured, or contains irrelevant information, the embeddings may not accurately represent the data and may not provide the desired results. Proper data preparation can help improve the quality of embeddings, leading to more accurate and efficient machine learning models. \n\nFor example, the pre-processing step of image data preparation involves removing image duplicates and images that have no information like extremely dark or overly bright images.\n\n\ud83d\udca1Read the blog on data curation and data curation tools to gain more insight on how to choose the right datasets for your computer vision or machine learning model.\nEmbedding using Machine Learning Techniques\nMost machine learning algorithms require numerical data as input. Therefore, you need to convert the data into a numerical format. This can involve creating a bag of words representation for text data, converting images into pixel values, or transforming graph data into a numerical matrix.\n\nOnce you have converted the data into a numerical format, you can embed it using machine learning techniques. The embedding process involves mapping the data from a higher-dimensional space to a lower-dimensional space while preserving its semantic meaning. Some of the popular embedding techniques are:\n\nScale your annotation workflows and power your model performance with data-driven insights\nTry Encord today\nmedical banner\nPrincipal Component Analysis (PCA) & Single Value Decomposition (SVD)\nPrincipal Component Analysis (PCA) is a dimensionality reduction technique that transforms the original data into a set of new, uncorrelated features (called principal components). It captures the most important information in the data while discarding the less important information.\n\nTo perform PCA for embedding, the original data is first centered and scaled to have zero mean and unit variance. Next, the covariance matrix of the centered data is calculated. The eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the covariance matrix are then computed, and the eigenvectors are sorted in descending order based on their corresponding eigenvalues. The top k eigenvectors are then selected to form the new feature space, where k is the desired dimensionality of the embedded space.\n\nblog image\n\nAn example where we transform five data points using PCA. The left graph is our original data; the right graph would be our transformed data. The two charts show the same data, but the right graph reflects the original data transformed so that the axes are now the principal components.\n\nSource\n\nFinally, the original data is projected onto the new feature space using the selected eigenvectors to obtain the embedded representation. PCA is a widely used technique for embedding, particularly for image and audio data, and has been used in a variety of applications such as facial recognition and speech recognition.\n\nSingular Value Decomposition (SVD) is used within PCA, so we will only cover this briefly. SVD decomposes a matrix into three matrices: U, \u03a3, and V. U represents the left singular vectors, S represents the singular values, and V represents the right singular vectors.\n\nblog image\n\nEquation of the SVD theorem.\n\nThe singular values and vectors capture the most important information in the original matrix, allowing for dimensionality reduction and embedding creation. Similar to PCA, SVD can be used to create embeddings for various types of data, including text, images, and graphs.\n\nSVD has been used for various machine learning tasks, such as recommendation systems, text classification, and image processing. It is a powerful technique for creating high-quality embeddings that can improve the performance of machine learning models.\n\nAuto-Encoder\nAutoencoders are neural network models used for unsupervised learning. They consist of an encoder network that maps the input data to a lower-dimensional representation (encoding) and a decoder network that attempts to reconstruct the original input data from the encoding. An autoencoder aims to learn a compressed and meaningful representation of the input data, effectively capturing the essential features.\n\nAutoencoders consist of an encoder neural network that compresses the input data into a lower-dimensional representation or embedding. The decoder network reconstructs the original data from the embedding. By training an eutoencoder on a dataset, the encoder network learns to extract meaningful features and compress the input data into a compact representation. These embeddings can be used for downstream tasks such as clustering, visualization, or transfer learning. \n\nWord2Vec\nWord2Vec is a popular technique for creating word embeddings, which represent words in a high-dimensional vector space. The technique works by training a neural network on a large corpus of text data, to predict the context in which a given word appears. The resulting embeddings capture semantic and syntactic relationships between words, such as similarity and analogy.\n\nWord2Vec is effective in various natural language processing tasks, such as language translation, text classification, and sentiment analysis. It also has applications in recommendation systems and image analysis.\n\nThere are two main approaches to implementing Word2Vec: the Continuous Bag-of-Words (CBOW) model and the Skip-gram model. CBOW predicts a target word given its surrounding context, while Skip-gram predicts the context given a target word. Both models have their advantages and disadvantages, and the choice between them depends on the specific application and the characteristics of the data.\n\nblog image\n\nLeft: CBOW architecture. Right: Skip-gram architecture. The CBOW architecture predicts the current word based on the context, and the Skip-gram predicts surrounding words given the current word.\n\nSource\n\nGloVe\nGloVe, which stands for Global Vectors for Word Representation, is another popular embedding technique that is used to represent words as vectors. Like Word2Vec, GloVe is also a neural network-based approach. However, unlike Word2Vec, which is based on a shallow neural network, GloVe uses a global matrix factorization technique to learn word embeddings.\n\nIn GloVe, the co-occurrence matrix of words is constructed by counting the number of times two words appear together in a given context. The rows of the matrix represent the words, and the columns represent the context in which the words appear. The matrix is then factorized into two separate matrices, one for words and the other for contexts. The product of these two matrices produces the final word embeddings.\n\nblog image\n\nExample of the GloVe embeddings.\n\nSource\n\nGloVe is known to perform well on various NLP tasks such as word analogy, word similarity, and named entity recognition. Additionally, GloVe has also been used for image classification tasks by converting image features into word-like entities and applying GloVe embeddings.\n\nBERT\nBERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a popular language model developed by Google that has been used for a variety of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including embedding. BERT is a deep learning model that uses a transformer architecture to generate word embeddings by taking into account the context of the words. This allows BERT to capture the semantic meaning of words, as well as the relationships between words in a sentence.\n\nblog image\n\nBERT is a pre-trained model that has been trained on massive amounts of text data, making it a powerful tool for generating high-quality word embeddings. BERT-based embeddings are highly effective in a range of NLP tasks, including sentiment analysis, text classification, and question-answering. Additionally, BERT allows for fine-tuning specific downstream tasks, which can lead to even more accurate results.\n\nblog image\n\nOverall pre-training and fine-tuning procedure for BERT\n\nSource\n\nOverall, BERT is a powerful tool for generating high-quality word embeddings that can be used in a wide range of NLP applications. One downside of BERT is that it can be computationally expensive, requiring significant resources for training and inference. However, pre-trained BERT models can be fine-tuned for specific use cases, reducing the need for expensive training.\n\nt-SNE\nt-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) is a widely used dimensionality reduction technique for visualizing high-dimensional data. While t-SNE is primarily used for visualization, it can also be used to generate embeddings. The process involves applying t-SNE to reduce the dimensionality of the data and obtaining a lower-dimensional embedding that captures the inherent structure of the original high-dimensional data.\n\nblog image\n\nSource\n\nt-SNE works by creating a probability distribution that measures the similarity between data points in high-dimensional space and a corresponding probability distribution in the low-dimensional space. It then minimizes the Kullback-Leibler divergence between these distributions to find an embedding that preserves the pairwise similarities between points.\n\nThe resulting embeddings from t-SNE can be used for various purposes such as clustering, anomaly detection, or as input to downstream machine learning algorithms. However, it's important to note that t-SNE is computationally expensive, and the generated embeddings should be interpreted carefully since they emphasize local structure and may not preserve the precise distances between points\n\nUMAP\nUMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) is a dimensionality reduction technique commonly used for generating embeddings. Unlike traditional methods like PCA or t-SNE, UMAP focuses on preserving both local and global structure in the data while maintaining computational efficiency.\n\nblog image\n\nSource\n\nUMAP works by constructing a low-dimensional representation of the data while preserving the neighborhood relationships. It achieves this by modeling the data as a topological structure and approximating the manifold on which the data lies. The algorithm iteratively optimizes a low-dimensional embedding that preserves the pairwise distances between nearby points.\n\nApplying UMAP to a dataset generates embeddings that capture the underlying structure and relationships in the data. These embeddings can be used for various purposes, such as visualization, clustering, or as input to other machine learning algorithms.\n\nUMAP has gained popularity in various domains, including image analysis, genomics, text mining, and recommendation systems, due to its ability to generate high-quality embeddings that preserve both local and global structures while being computationally efficient.\n\nAnalyzing and validating embeddings is an important step in quality assurance to ensure that the generated embeddings accurately represent the underlying data.\n\nScale your annotation workflows and power your model performance with data-driven insights\nTry Encord today\nmedical banner\nAnalyzing and Validating Embeddings for Quality Assurance\nOne common method for analyzing embeddings is to visualize them in a lower-dimensional space, such as 2D or 3D, using techniques like t-SNE or PCA. This can help identify clusters or patterns in the data and provide insights into the quality of the embeddings.\n\nThere are platforms that create and plot the embeddings of the dataset. These plots are helpful when you want to visualize your dataset in the lower-dimensional space. Visualizing the data in this lower-dimensional space makes it easier to identify any potential issues or biases in the data, which can be addressed to improve the quality of the embeddings. Visualizing embeddings can help evaluate and compare different models by providing an intuitive way to assess the quality and usefulness of the embeddings for specific tasks.\n\nOne example is the Encord Active platform, which provides a 2D embedding plot of an image dataset, enabling users to visualize the images within a particular cluster. This simplifies the process of identifying outliers through embeddings. The 2D embedding plot is not only useful in validating the data quality but also the label quality of the dataset.\n\nblog image\n\nA 2D embedding plot of the Rareplanes dataset\n\nValidation of embeddings involves evaluating their performance on downstream tasks, such as classification or prediction, and comparing it with other methods. This can help determine the effectiveness of the embeddings in real-world scenarios and highlight areas for improvement.\n\nAnother aspect of validation is measuring the degree of bias present in the embeddings. This is important because embeddings can reflect biases in the training data, leading to discriminatory or unfair outcomes. Techniques like de-biasing can be used to remove these biases and ensure that the embeddings are fair and unbiased.\n\nvector-try-encord\nScale your annotation workflows and power your model performance with data-driven insights\nTry Encord today\nmedical banner\nNow that we have explored the creation and analysis of embeddings, let's examine a case study to gain a deeper understanding of how embeddings can benefit machine learning models when compared to traditional machine learning algorithms.\n\nCase Study: Embeddings and Object Classification\nThis case study focuses on the effect of embeddings on object classification algorithms. By visualizing the embeddings of the training dataset, we can explore their impact on the process.\n\nImage classification is a popular application of machine learning, and embeddings are effective for this task. Embedding-based approaches to image classification involve learning a lower-dimensional representation of the image data and using this representation as input to a machine learning model.\n\nblog image\n\nExample of dog classification \n\nAnalyzing the embeddings can reduce the need for manual feature engineering. Compared to traditional machine learning algorithms, embedding-based approaches enable more efficient computation. Hence, the trained model will often achieve higher accuracy and better generalization to new, unseen data. Let's visualize the embeddings to understand this better.\n\nVisualizing embeddings\nHere, we will be using the Encord Active platform to visualize the embedding plot of the Caltech-101 dataset. \n\nThe Caltech-101 dataset consists of images of objects categorized into 101 classes. Each image in the dataset has different dimensions, but they are generally of medium resolution, with dimensions ranging from 200 x 200 to 500 x 500 pixels.

By converting input data into machine-readable formats, businesses can leverage AI technology to transform workflows, streamline processes, and optimize performance.\n\nMachine learning is a powerful tool that has the potential to transform the way we live and work. However, the success of any machine learning model depends heavily on the quality of the training data that is used to develop it. High-quality training data is often considered to be the most critical factor in achieving accurate and reliable machine learning results.\n\nIn this blog, we\u2019ll discuss the importance of high-quality training data in machine learning and how AI embeddings can help improve it. We will cover:\n\nImportance of high-quality training data\nCreating high-quality training data using AI embeddings\nCase studies demonstrating the use of embeddings \nBest practices for using AI embeddings\nLeverage embeddings to analyze and fix your dataset and labels using Encord Active\nLearn more\nmedical banner\nImportance of High-Quality Training Data\nThe importance of high-quality training data in machine learning lies in the fact that it directly impacts the accuracy and reliability of machine learning models. For a model to accurately learn patterns and make predictions, it needs to be trained on large volumes of diverse, accurate, and unbiased data. If the data used for training is low-quality or contains inaccuracies and biases, it will produce less accurate and potentially biased predictions.\n\nThe quality of datasets being used to train models applies to every type of AI model, including Foundation Models, such as ChatGPT and Google\u2019s BERT. The Washington Post took a closer look at the vast datasets being used to train some of the world\u2019s most popular and powerful large language models (LLMs). In particular, the article reviewed the content of Google\u2019s C4 dataset, finding that quality and quantity are equally important, especially when training LLMs.  \n\nIn image recognition tasks, if the training data used to teach the model contains images with inaccurate or incomplete labels, then the model may not be able to recognize or classify similar images in its predictions accurately.\n\nAt the same time, if the training data is biased towards certain groups or demographics, then the model may learn and replicate those biases, leading to unfair or discriminatory treatment of certain groups. For instance, Google, too, succumbed to bias traps in a recent incident where its Vision AI model generated racist outcomes.\n\nblog image\n\nThe images in the BDD dataset have a pedestrian labeled as remote and book, which is clearly annotated wrongly. \n\nHence, using high-quality training data is crucial to ensuring accurate and unbiased machine learning models. This involves selecting appropriate and diverse data sources and ensuring the data is cleaned, preprocessed, and labeled accurately before being used for training.\n\nWhat is an Embedding in Machine Learning?\nIn artificial intelligence, an embedding is a mathematical representation of a set of data points in a lower-dimensional space that captures their underlying relationships and patterns. Embeddings are often used to represent complex data types, such as images, text, or audio, in a way that machine learning algorithms can easily process.\n\nEmbeddings differ from other machine learning techniques in that they are learned through training a model on a large dataset rather than being explicitly defined by a human expert. This allows the model to learn complex patterns and relationships in the data that may be difficult or impossible for a human to identify.\n\nOnce learned, embeddings can be used as features for other machine learning models, such as classifiers or regressors. This allows the model to make predictions or decisions based on the underlying patterns and relationships in the data, rather than just the raw input.\n\n\ud83d\udca1To make things easier, companies like OpenAI also offer services to extract embeddings from your data. Read to find out more.\nTypes of Embeddings\nSeveral types of embeddings can be used in machine learning, including\n\nImage Embeddings\nImage embeddings are used to represent images in a lower-dimensional space. These embeddings capture the visual features of an image, such as color and texture, allowing machine learning models to perform image classification, object detection, and other computer vision tasks.\n\nblog image\n\nExample of visualization of image embeddings. Here the BDD dataset is visualized in a 2D embedding plot on the Encord platform. \n\nWord Embeddings\nWord embeddings are used to represent words as vectors in a low-dimensional space. These embeddings capture the meaning and relationships between words, allowing machine learning models to better understand and process natural language.\n\nblog image\n\nExample of visualization of word embeddings. \n\nSource\n\nGraph Embeddings\nGraph embeddings are used to represent graphs, which are networks of interconnected nodes, as vectors in a low-dimensional space. These embeddings capture the relationships between nodes in a graph, allowing machine learning models to perform node classification and link prediction tasks.\n\nblog image\n\nLeft: The well-known Karate graph representing a social network. Right: A continuous space embedding of the nodes of the graph using DeepWalk. \n\nBy capturing the essence of the data in a lower-dimensional space, embeddings enable efficient computation and discovery of complex patterns and relationships that might not be otherwise apparent. These benefits enable various applications of AI embeddings, as discussed below.\n\nApplications of Embeddings\nAI embeddings have numerous applications in data creation and machine learning, including\n\nImproving Data Quality\nAI embeddings can help improve data quality by reducing noise, removing outliers, and capturing semantic relationships. This is particularly useful in scenarios where the data needs to be more structured or contain missing values. For example, in natural language processing, word embeddings can represent words with similar meanings closer together, enabling better semantic understanding and enhancing the accuracy of various language-related tasks.\n\n\ud83d\udca1Read 5 ways to improve the quality of the training data.\nReducing the Need for Manual Data Labeling\nAI embeddings can automatically label data based on its embedding representation. This can save time and resources, especially when dealing with large datasets.\n\nReducing Computation\nEmbeddings are useful in reducing computation by representing high-dimensional data in a lower-dimensional space. For example, a 256 x 256 image contains 65,536 pixels in image processing, resulting in many features if directly used. Using a CNN, the image can be transformed into a 1000-dimensional feature vector, consolidating the information. This compression significantly reduces computational requirements, approximately 65 times less, allowing for more efficient image processing and analysis without sacrificing essential details.\n\nEnhancing Natual Language Processing (NLP)\nWord embeddings are widely used in NLP applications such as sentiment analysis, language translation, and chatbot development. Mapping words to vector representations makes it easier for machine learning algorithms to understand the relationships between words.\n\nblog image\n\nSource\n\nImproving Recommendation Systems\nCollaborative filtering, a type of recommendation system uses user and item embeddings to make personalized recommendations. By embedding user and item data in a vector space, the algorithm, can identify similar items and recommend them to users.\n\nEnhancing Image and Video Processing\nImage and video embeddings can be used for object detection, recognition, and classification. Mapping images and videos to vector representations makes it easier for machine learning algorithms to identify and classify different objects within them.\n\nHence, the applications of AI embeddings are diverse and offer many benefits, including improving data quality and reducing the need for manual data labeling. Now, let's delve into how this can be beneficial when utilizing AI embeddings for generating high-quality training data.\n\nFrom scaling to enhancing your model development with data-driven insights\nLearn more\nmedical banner\nBenefits of Embeddings in Data Creation\nHere are a few of the benefits of using embeddings in data creation:\n\nCreate a Larger and Diverse Dataset\nBy automatically identifying patterns and relationships within data, embeddings can help to fill in gaps and identify outliers that might be missed by manual labeling. For example, embeddings can help fill in gaps by leveraging the learned patterns and relationships within the data. \n\nAI models can make informed estimations or predictions for missing values by analyzing the surrounding representations, allowing for more complete and reliable data analysis. This can help improve the accuracy of machine learning models by providing more comprehensive and representative data for training.\n\nblog image\n\nSource\n\nReduce Bias\nUsing AI embeddings in training data can help reduce bias by enabling a more nuanced understanding of the relationships and patterns in the data, allowing for identifying and mitigating potential sources of bias. This can help to ensure that machine learning models are trained on fair and representative data, leading to more accurate and unbiased predictions.\n\n\ud83d\udca1Read to find out five more ways to reduce bias in your training data.\nImprove Model Performance\nAI embeddings offer several benefits such as increased efficiency, better generalization, and enhanced performance in various machine learning tasks. They enable efficient computation and discovery of complex patterns, reduce overfitting, and capture the underlying structure of the data to generalize better on new, unseen data.\n\nHow to Create High-Quality Training Data Using Embeddings\nData Preparation\nThe first step is preparing the data for embedding. The data preparation step is crucial for embedding because the input data's quality determines the resulting embeddings' quality. \n\nThe first step is to collect the data you want to use for training your model. This can include text data, image data, or graph data. Once you have collected the data, you need to clean and preprocess it to remove any noise or irrelevant information. For example, in text data, data cleaning involves:\n\nTokenizing the text into individual words or phrases.\nRemoving stop words.\nCorrecting spelling errors.\nRemoving punctuation marks.\nYou may need to resize or crop images to a uniform size for image data.\n\nIf the data is noisy, unstructured, or contains irrelevant information, the embeddings may not accurately represent the data and may not provide the desired results. Proper data preparation can help improve the quality of embeddings, leading to more accurate and efficient machine learning models. \n\nFor example, the pre-processing step of image data preparation involves removing image duplicates and images that have no information like extremely dark or overly bright images.\n\n\ud83d\udca1Read the blog on data curation and data curation tools to gain more insight on how to choose the right datasets for your computer vision or machine learning model.\nEmbedding using Machine Learning Techniques\nMost machine learning algorithms require numerical data as input. Therefore, you need to convert the data into a numerical format. This can involve creating a bag of words representation for text data, converting images into pixel values, or transforming graph data into a numerical matrix.\n\nOnce you have converted the data into a numerical format, you can embed it using machine learning techniques. The embedding process involves mapping the data from a higher-dimensional space to a lower-dimensional space while preserving its semantic meaning. Some of the popular embedding techniques are:\n\nScale your annotation workflows and power your model performance with data-driven insights\nTry Encord today\nmedical banner\nPrincipal Component Analysis (PCA) & Single Value Decomposition (SVD)\nPrincipal Component Analysis (PCA) is a dimensionality reduction technique that transforms the original data into a set of new, uncorrelated features (called principal components). It captures the most important information in the data while discarding the less important information.\n\nTo perform PCA for embedding, the original data is first centered and scaled to have zero mean and unit variance. Next, the covariance matrix of the centered data is calculated. The eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the covariance matrix are then computed, and the eigenvectors are sorted in descending order based on their corresponding eigenvalues. The top k eigenvectors are then selected to form the new feature space, where k is the desired dimensionality of the embedded space.\n\nblog image\n\nAn example where we transform five data points using PCA. The left graph is our original data; the right graph would be our transformed data. The two charts show the same data, but the right graph reflects the original data transformed so that the axes are now the principal components.\n\nSource\n\nFinally, the original data is projected onto the new feature space using the selected eigenvectors to obtain the embedded representation. PCA is a widely used technique for embedding, particularly for image and audio data, and has been used in a variety of applications such as facial recognition and speech recognition.\n\nSingular Value Decomposition (SVD) is used within PCA, so we will only cover this briefly. SVD decomposes a matrix into three matrices: U, \u03a3, and V. U represents the left singular vectors, S represents the singular values, and V represents the right singular vectors.\n\nblog image\n\nEquation of the SVD theorem.\n\nThe singular values and vectors capture the most important information in the original matrix, allowing for dimensionality reduction and embedding creation. Similar to PCA, SVD can be used to create embeddings for various types of data, including text, images, and graphs.\n\nSVD has been used for various machine learning tasks, such as recommendation systems, text classification, and image processing. It is a powerful technique for creating high-quality embeddings that can improve the performance of machine learning models.\n\nAuto-Encoder\nAutoencoders are neural network models used for unsupervised learning. They consist of an encoder network that maps the input data to a lower-dimensional representation (encoding) and a decoder network that attempts to reconstruct the original input data from the encoding. An autoencoder aims to learn a compressed and meaningful representation of the input data, effectively capturing the essential features.\n\nAutoencoders consist of an encoder neural network that compresses the input data into a lower-dimensional representation or embedding. The decoder network reconstructs the original data from the embedding. By training an eutoencoder on a dataset, the encoder network learns to extract meaningful features and compress the input data into a compact representation. These embeddings can be used for downstream tasks such as clustering, visualization, or transfer learning. \n\nWord2Vec\nWord2Vec is a popular technique for creating word embeddings, which represent words in a high-dimensional vector space. The technique works by training a neural network on a large corpus of text data, to predict the context in which a given word appears. The resulting embeddings capture semantic and syntactic relationships between words, such as similarity and analogy.\n\nWord2Vec is effective in various natural language processing tasks, such as language translation, text classification, and sentiment analysis. It also has applications in recommendation systems and image analysis.\n\nThere are two main approaches to implementing Word2Vec: the Continuous Bag-of-Words (CBOW) model and the Skip-gram model. CBOW predicts a target word given its surrounding context, while Skip-gram predicts the context given a target word. Both models have their advantages and disadvantages, and the choice between them depends on the specific application and the characteristics of the data.\n\nblog image\n\nLeft: CBOW architecture. Right: Skip-gram architecture. The CBOW architecture predicts the current word based on the context, and the Skip-gram predicts surrounding words given the current word.\n\nSource\n\nGloVe\nGloVe, which stands for Global Vectors for Word Representation, is another popular embedding technique that is used to represent words as vectors. Like Word2Vec, GloVe is also a neural network-based approach. However, unlike Word2Vec, which is based on a shallow neural network, GloVe uses a global matrix factorization technique to learn word embeddings.\n\nIn GloVe, the co-occurrence matrix of words is constructed by counting the number of times two words appear together in a given context. The rows of the matrix represent the words, and the columns represent the context in which the words appear. The matrix is then factorized into two separate matrices, one for words and the other for contexts. The product of these two matrices produces the final word embeddings.\n\nblog image\n\nExample of the GloVe embeddings.\n\nSource\n\nGloVe is known to perform well on various NLP tasks such as word analogy, word similarity, and named entity recognition. Additionally, GloVe has also been used for image classification tasks by converting image features into word-like entities and applying GloVe embeddings.\n\nBERT\nBERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a popular language model developed by Google that has been used for a variety of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including embedding. BERT is a deep learning model that uses a transformer architecture to generate word embeddings by taking into account the context of the words. This allows BERT to capture the semantic meaning of words, as well as the relationships between words in a sentence.\n\nblog image\n\nBERT is a pre-trained model that has been trained on massive amounts of text data, making it a powerful tool for generating high-quality word embeddings. BERT-based embeddings are highly effective in a range of NLP tasks, including sentiment analysis, text classification, and question-answering. Additionally, BERT allows for fine-tuning specific downstream tasks, which can lead to even more accurate results.\n\nblog image\n\nOverall pre-training and fine-tuning procedure for BERT\n\nSource\n\nOverall, BERT is a powerful tool for generating high-quality word embeddings that can be used in a wide range of NLP applications. One downside of BERT is that it can be computationally expensive, requiring significant resources for training and inference. However, pre-trained BERT models can be fine-tuned for specific use cases, reducing the need for expensive training.\n\nt-SNE\nt-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) is a widely used dimensionality reduction technique for visualizing high-dimensional data. While t-SNE is primarily used for visualization, it can also be used to generate embeddings. The process involves applying t-SNE to reduce the dimensionality of the data and obtaining a lower-dimensional embedding that captures the inherent structure of the original high-dimensional data.\n\nblog image\n\nSource\n\nt-SNE works by creating a probability distribution that measures the similarity between data points in high-dimensional space and a corresponding probability distribution in the low-dimensional space. It then minimizes the Kullback-Leibler divergence between these distributions to find an embedding that preserves the pairwise similarities between points.\n\nThe resulting embeddings from t-SNE can be used for various purposes such as clustering, anomaly detection, or as input to downstream machine learning algorithms. However, it's important to note that t-SNE is computationally expensive, and the generated embeddings should be interpreted carefully since they emphasize local structure and may not preserve the precise distances between points\n\nUMAP\nUMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) is a dimensionality reduction technique commonly used for generating embeddings. Unlike traditional methods like PCA or t-SNE, UMAP focuses on preserving both local and global structure in the data while maintaining computational efficiency.\n\nblog image\n\nSource\n\nUMAP works by constructing a low-dimensional representation of the data while preserving the neighborhood relationships. It achieves this by modeling the data as a topological structure and approximating the manifold on which the data lies. The algorithm iteratively optimizes a low-dimensional embedding that preserves the pairwise distances between nearby points.\n\nApplying UMAP to a dataset generates embeddings that capture the underlying structure and relationships in the data. These embeddings can be used for various purposes, such as visualization, clustering, or as input to other machine learning algorithms.\n\nUMAP has gained popularity in various domains, including image analysis, genomics, text mining, and recommendation systems, due to its ability to generate high-quality embeddings that preserve both local and global structures while being computationally efficient.\n\nAnalyzing and validating embeddings is an important step in quality assurance to ensure that the generated embeddings accurately represent the underlying data.\n\nScale your annotation workflows and power your model performance with data-driven insights\nTry Encord today\nmedical banner\nAnalyzing and Validating Embeddings for Quality Assurance\nOne common method for analyzing embeddings is to visualize them in a lower-dimensional space, such as 2D or 3D, using techniques like t-SNE or PCA. This can help identify clusters or patterns in the data and provide insights into the quality of the embeddings.\n\nThere are platforms that create and plot the embeddings of the dataset. These plots are helpful when you want to visualize your dataset in the lower-dimensional space. Visualizing the data in this lower-dimensional space makes it easier to identify any potential issues or biases in the data, which can be addressed to improve the quality of the embeddings. Visualizing embeddings can help evaluate and compare different models by providing an intuitive way to assess the quality and usefulness of the embeddings for specific tasks.\n\nOne example is the Encord Active platform, which provides a 2D embedding plot of an image dataset, enabling users to visualize the images within a particular cluster. This simplifies the process of identifying outliers through embeddings. The 2D embedding plot is not only useful in validating the data quality but also the label quality of the dataset.\n\nblog image\n\nA 2D embedding plot of the Rareplanes dataset\n\nValidation of embeddings involves evaluating their performance on downstream tasks, such as classification or prediction, and comparing it with other methods. This can help determine the effectiveness of the embeddings in real-world scenarios and highlight areas for improvement.\n\nAnother aspect of validation is measuring the degree of bias present in the embeddings. This is important because embeddings can reflect biases in the training data, leading to discriminatory or unfair outcomes. Techniques like de-biasing can be used to remove these biases and ensure that the embeddings are fair and unbiased.\n\nvector-try-encord\nScale your annotation workflows and power your model performance with data-driven insights\nTry Encord today\nmedical banner\nNow that we have explored the creation and analysis of embeddings, let's examine a case study to gain a deeper understanding of how embeddings can benefit machine learning models when compared to traditional machine learning algorithms.\n\nCase Study: Embeddings and Object Classification\nThis case study focuses on the effect of embeddings on object classification algorithms. By visualizing the embeddings of the training dataset, we can explore their impact on the process.\n\nImage classification is a popular application of machine learning, and embeddings are effective for this task. Embedding-based approaches to image classification involve learning a lower-dimensional representation of the image data and using this representation as input to a machine learning model.\n\nblog image\n\nExample of dog classification \n\nAnalyzing the embeddings can reduce the need for manual feature engineering. Compared to traditional machine learning algorithms, embedding-based approaches enable more efficient computation. Hence, the trained model will often achieve higher accuracy and better generalization to new, unseen data. Let's visualize the embeddings to understand this better.\n\nVisualizing embeddings\nHere, we will be using the Encord Active platform to visualize the embedding plot of the Caltech-101 dataset. \n\nThe Caltech-101 dataset consists of images of objects categorized into 101 classes. Each image in the dataset has different dimensions, but they are generally of medium resolution, with dimensions ranging from 200 x 200 to 500 x 500 pixels. However, the number of dimensions in the dataset will depend on the number of features used to represent each image. In general, most Caltech-101 image features will have hundreds or thousands of dimensions and it will be helpful to visualize it in lower-dimensional space.\n\nblog image\n\nExample of images presented in Caltech101 dataset\n\nSource\n\nRun the following commands in your favorite Python environment with the following commands will download Encord Active:\n\npython3.9 -m venv ea-venv\nsource ea-venv/bin/activate\n# within venv\npip install encord-active\nOr you can follow through the following command to install Encord Active using GitHub:\n\npip install git+https://github.com/encord-team/encord-active\nTo check if Encord Active has been installed, run:\n\nencord-active --help\nEncord Active has many sandbox datasets like the MNIST, BDD100K, TACO dataset, and much more.

The position of each point on the plot reflects the relative similarity or dissimilarity of the data points with respect to each other. For example, select the box or the Lasso Select in the upper right corner of the plot. Once you select a region, you can visualize the images only in the selected region.\n\nblog image\n\nBy projecting the data into two dimensions, you can now see clusters of similar data points, outliers, and other patterns that may be useful for data analysis.\n\nblog image\n\nFor example, we see in the selected cluster, there is one outlier.\n\nThe 2D embedding plot in label quality shows the data points of each image and each color represents the class the object belongs to. This helps in finding out the outliers by spotting the unexpected relationships or possible areas of model bias for object labels. \n\nThis plot also shows the separability of the dataset. A separable dataset is useful for object recognition because it allows for the use of simpler and more efficient computer vision models that can achieve high accuracy with relatively few parameters. \n\nblog image\n\nThe 2D embedding plot in the Label Quality Explorer page of Encord.\n\nA separable dataset is a useful starting point for object classification, as it allows us to quickly develop and evaluate simple machine learning models before exploring more complex models if needed. It also helps us better understand the data and the features that distinguish the different classes of objects, which can be useful for developing more sophisticated models in the future.\n\n\ud83d\udca1Read the detailed analysis of the Caltech101 dataset to understand the dataset better.

We will cover:\n\nImportance of high-quality training data\nCreating high-quality training data using AI embeddings\nCase studies demonstrating the use of embeddings \nBest practices for using AI embeddings\nLeverage embeddings to analyze and fix your dataset and labels using Encord Active\nLearn more\nmedical banner\nImportance of High-Quality Training Data\nThe importance of high-quality training data in machine learning lies in the fact that it directly impacts the accuracy and reliability of machine learning models. For a model to accurately learn patterns and make predictions, it needs to be trained on large volumes of diverse, accurate, and unbiased data. If the data used for training is low-quality or contains inaccuracies and biases, it will produce less accurate and potentially biased predictions.\n\nThe quality of datasets being used to train models applies to every type of AI model, including Foundation Models, such as ChatGPT and Google\u2019s BERT. The Washington Post took a closer look at the vast datasets being used to train some of the world\u2019s most popular and powerful large language models (LLMs). In particular, the article reviewed the content of Google\u2019s C4 dataset, finding that quality and quantity are equally important, especially when training LLMs.  \n\nIn image recognition tasks, if the training data used to teach the model contains images with inaccurate or incomplete labels, then the model may not be able to recognize or classify similar images in its predictions accurately.\n\nAt the same time, if the training data is biased towards certain groups or demographics, then the model may learn and replicate those biases, leading to unfair or discriminatory treatment of certain groups. For instance, Google, too, succumbed to bias traps in a recent incident where its Vision AI model generated racist outcomes.\n\nblog image\n\nThe images in the BDD dataset have a pedestrian labeled as remote and book, which is clearly annotated wrongly. \n\nHence, using high-quality training data is crucial to ensuring accurate and unbiased machine learning models. This involves selecting appropriate and diverse data sources and ensuring the data is cleaned, preprocessed, and labeled accurately before being used for training.\n\nWhat is an Embedding in Machine Learning?\nIn artificial intelligence, an embedding is a mathematical representation of a set of data points in a lower-dimensional space that captures their underlying relationships and patterns. Embeddings are often used to represent complex data types, such as images, text, or audio, in a way that machine learning algorithms can easily process.\n\nEmbeddings differ from other machine learning techniques in that they are learned through training a model on a large dataset rather than being explicitly defined by a human expert. This allows the model to learn complex patterns and relationships in the data that may be difficult or impossible for a human to identify.\n\nOnce learned, embeddings can be used as features for other machine learning models, such as classifiers or regressors. This allows the model to make predictions or decisions based on the underlying patterns and relationships in the data, rather than just the raw input.\n\n\ud83d\udca1To make things easier, companies like OpenAI also offer services to extract embeddings from your data. Read to find out more.\nTypes of Embeddings\nSeveral types of embeddings can be used in machine learning, including\n\nImage Embeddings\nImage embeddings are used to represent images in a lower-dimensional space. These embeddings capture the visual features of an image, such as color and texture, allowing machine learning models to perform image classification, object detection, and other computer vision tasks.\n\nblog image\n\nExample of visualization of image embeddings. Here the BDD dataset is visualized in a 2D embedding plot on the Encord platform. \n\nWord Embeddings\nWord embeddings are used to represent words as vectors in a low-dimensional space. These embeddings capture the meaning and relationships between words, allowing machine learning models to better understand and process natural language.\n\nblog image\n\nExample of visualization of word embeddings. \n\nSource\n\nGraph Embeddings\nGraph embeddings are used to represent graphs, which are networks of interconnected nodes, as vectors in a low-dimensional space. These embeddings capture the relationships between nodes in a graph, allowing machine learning models to perform node classification and link prediction tasks.\n\nblog image\n\nLeft: The well-known Karate graph representing a social network. Right: A continuous space embedding of the nodes of the graph using DeepWalk. \n\nBy capturing the essence of the data in a lower-dimensional space, embeddings enable efficient computation and discovery of complex patterns and relationships that might not be otherwise apparent. These benefits enable various applications of AI embeddings, as discussed below.\n\nApplications of Embeddings\nAI embeddings have numerous applications in data creation and machine learning, including\n\nImproving Data Quality\nAI embeddings can help improve data quality by reducing noise, removing outliers, and capturing semantic relationships. This is particularly useful in scenarios where the data needs to be more structured or contain missing values. For example, in natural language processing, word embeddings can represent words with similar meanings closer together, enabling better semantic understanding and enhancing the accuracy of various language-related tasks.\n\n\ud83d\udca1Read 5 ways to improve the quality of the training data.\nReducing the Need for Manual Data Labeling\nAI embeddings can automatically label data based on its embedding representation. This can save time and resources, especially when dealing with large datasets.\n\nReducing Computation\nEmbeddings are useful in reducing computation by representing high-dimensional data in a lower-dimensional space. For example, a 256 x 256 image contains 65,536 pixels in image processing, resulting in many features if directly used. Using a CNN, the image can be transformed into a 1000-dimensional feature vector, consolidating the information. This compression significantly reduces computational requirements, approximately 65 times less, allowing for more efficient image processing and analysis without sacrificing essential details.\n\nEnhancing Natual Language Processing (NLP)\nWord embeddings are widely used in NLP applications such as sentiment analysis, language translation, and chatbot development. Mapping words to vector representations makes it easier for machine learning algorithms to understand the relationships between words.\n\nblog image\n\nSource\n\nImproving Recommendation Systems\nCollaborative filtering, a type of recommendation system uses user and item embeddings to make personalized recommendations. By embedding user and item data in a vector space, the algorithm, can identify similar items and recommend them to users.\n\nEnhancing Image and Video Processing\nImage and video embeddings can be used for object detection, recognition, and classification. Mapping images and videos to vector representations makes it easier for machine learning algorithms to identify and classify different objects within them.\n\nHence, the applications of AI embeddings are diverse and offer many benefits, including improving data quality and reducing the need for manual data labeling. Now, let's delve into how this can be beneficial when utilizing AI embeddings for generating high-quality training data.\n\nFrom scaling to enhancing your model development with data-driven insights\nLearn more\nmedical banner\nBenefits of Embeddings in Data Creation\nHere are a few of the benefits of using embeddings in data creation:\n\nCreate a Larger and Diverse Dataset\nBy automatically identifying patterns and relationships within data, embeddings can help to fill in gaps and identify outliers that might be missed by manual labeling. For example, embeddings can help fill in gaps by leveraging the learned patterns and relationships within the data. \n\nAI models can make informed estimations or predictions for missing values by analyzing the surrounding representations, allowing for more complete and reliable data analysis. This can help improve the accuracy of machine learning models by providing more comprehensive and representative data for training.\n\nblog image\n\nSource\n\nReduce Bias\nUsing AI embeddings in training data can help reduce bias by enabling a more nuanced understanding of the relationships and patterns in the data, allowing for identifying and mitigating potential sources of bias. This can help to ensure that machine learning models are trained on fair and representative data, leading to more accurate and unbiased predictions.\n\n\ud83d\udca1Read to find out five more ways to reduce bias in your training data.\nImprove Model Performance\nAI embeddings offer several benefits such as increased efficiency, better generalization, and enhanced performance in various machine learning tasks. They enable efficient computation and discovery of complex patterns, reduce overfitting, and capture the underlying structure of the data to generalize better on new, unseen data.\n\nHow to Create High-Quality Training Data Using Embeddings\nData Preparation\nThe first step is preparing the data for embedding. The data preparation step is crucial for embedding because the input data's quality determines the resulting embeddings' quality. \n\nThe first step is to collect the data you want to use for training your model. This can include text data, image data, or graph data. Once you have collected the data, you need to clean and preprocess it to remove any noise or irrelevant information. For example, in text data, data cleaning involves:\n\nTokenizing the text into individual words or phrases.\nRemoving stop words.\nCorrecting spelling errors.\nRemoving punctuation marks.\nYou may need to resize or crop images to a uniform size for image data.\n\nIf the data is noisy, unstructured, or contains irrelevant information, the embeddings may not accurately represent the data and may not provide the desired results. Proper data preparation can help improve the quality of embeddings, leading to more accurate and efficient machine learning models. \n\nFor example, the pre-processing step of image data preparation involves removing image duplicates and images that have no information like extremely dark or overly bright images.\n\n\ud83d\udca1Read the blog on data curation and data curation tools to gain more insight on how to choose the right datasets for your computer vision or machine learning model.\nEmbedding using Machine Learning Techniques\nMost machine learning algorithms require numerical data as input. Therefore, you need to convert the data into a numerical format. This can involve creating a bag of words representation for text data, converting images into pixel values, or transforming graph data into a numerical matrix.\n\nOnce you have converted the data into a numerical format, you can embed it using machine learning techniques. The embedding process involves mapping the data from a higher-dimensional space to a lower-dimensional space while preserving its semantic meaning. Some of the popular embedding techniques are:\n\nScale your annotation workflows and power your model performance with data-driven insights\nTry Encord today\nmedical banner\nPrincipal Component Analysis (PCA) & Single Value Decomposition (SVD)\nPrincipal Component Analysis (PCA) is a dimensionality reduction technique that transforms the original data into a set of new, uncorrelated features (called principal components). It captures the most important information in the data while discarding the less important information.\n\nTo perform PCA for embedding, the original data is first centered and scaled to have zero mean and unit variance. Next, the covariance matrix of the centered data is calculated. The eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the covariance matrix are then computed, and the eigenvectors are sorted in descending order based on their corresponding eigenvalues. The top k eigenvectors are then selected to form the new feature space, where k is the desired dimensionality of the embedded space.\n\nblog image\n\nAn example where we transform five data points using PCA. The left graph is our original data; the right graph would be our transformed data. The two charts show the same data, but the right graph reflects the original data transformed so that the axes are now the principal components.\n\nSource\n\nFinally, the original data is projected onto the new feature space using the selected eigenvectors to obtain the embedded representation. PCA is a widely used technique for embedding, particularly for image and audio data, and has been used in a variety of applications such as facial recognition and speech recognition.\n\nSingular Value Decomposition (SVD) is used within PCA, so we will only cover this briefly. SVD decomposes a matrix into three matrices: U, \u03a3, and V. U represents the left singular vectors, S represents the singular values, and V represents the right singular vectors.\n\nblog image\n\nEquation of the SVD theorem.\n\nThe singular values and vectors capture the most important information in the original matrix, allowing for dimensionality reduction and embedding creation. Similar to PCA, SVD can be used to create embeddings for various types of data, including text, images, and graphs.\n\nSVD has been used for various machine learning tasks, such as recommendation systems, text classification, and image processing. It is a powerful technique for creating high-quality embeddings that can improve the performance of machine learning models.\n\nAuto-Encoder\nAutoencoders are neural network models used for unsupervised learning. They consist of an encoder network that maps the input data to a lower-dimensional representation (encoding) and a decoder network that attempts to reconstruct the original input data from the encoding. An autoencoder aims to learn a compressed and meaningful representation of the input data, effectively capturing the essential features.\n\nAutoencoders consist of an encoder neural network that compresses the input data into a lower-dimensional representation or embedding. The decoder network reconstructs the original data from the embedding. By training an eutoencoder on a dataset, the encoder network learns to extract meaningful features and compress the input data into a compact representation. These embeddings can be used for downstream tasks such as clustering, visualization, or transfer learning. \n\nWord2Vec\nWord2Vec is a popular technique for creating word embeddings, which represent words in a high-dimensional vector space. The technique works by training a neural network on a large corpus of text data, to predict the context in which a given word appears. The resulting embeddings capture semantic and syntactic relationships between words, such as similarity and analogy.\n\nWord2Vec is effective in various natural language processing tasks, such as language translation, text classification, and sentiment analysis. It also has applications in recommendation systems and image analysis.\n\nThere are two main approaches to implementing Word2Vec: the Continuous Bag-of-Words (CBOW) model and the Skip-gram model. CBOW predicts a target word given its surrounding context, while Skip-gram predicts the context given a target word. Both models have their advantages and disadvantages, and the choice between them depends on the specific application and the characteristics of the data.\n\nblog image\n\nLeft: CBOW architecture. Right: Skip-gram architecture. The CBOW architecture predicts the current word based on the context, and the Skip-gram predicts surrounding words given the current word.\n\nSource\n\nGloVe\nGloVe, which stands for Global Vectors for Word Representation, is another popular embedding technique that is used to represent words as vectors. Like Word2Vec, GloVe is also a neural network-based approach. However, unlike Word2Vec, which is based on a shallow neural network, GloVe uses a global matrix factorization technique to learn word embeddings.\n\nIn GloVe, the co-occurrence matrix of words is constructed by counting the number of times two words appear together in a given context. The rows of the matrix represent the words, and the columns represent the context in which the words appear. The matrix is then factorized into two separate matrices, one for words and the other for contexts. The product of these two matrices produces the final word embeddings.\n\nblog image\n\nExample of the GloVe embeddings.\n\nSource\n\nGloVe is known to perform well on various NLP tasks such as word analogy, word similarity, and named entity recognition. Additionally, GloVe has also been used for image classification tasks by converting image features into word-like entities and applying GloVe embeddings.\n\nBERT\nBERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a popular language model developed by Google that has been used for a variety of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including embedding. BERT is a deep learning model that uses a transformer architecture to generate word embeddings by taking into account the context of the words. This allows BERT to capture the semantic meaning of words, as well as the relationships between words in a sentence.\n\nblog image\n\nBERT is a pre-trained model that has been trained on massive amounts of text data, making it a powerful tool for generating high-quality word embeddings. BERT-based embeddings are highly effective in a range of NLP tasks, including sentiment analysis, text classification, and question-answering. Additionally, BERT allows for fine-tuning specific downstream tasks, which can lead to even more accurate results.\n\nblog image\n\nOverall pre-training and fine-tuning procedure for BERT\n\nSource\n\nOverall, BERT is a powerful tool for generating high-quality word embeddings that can be used in a wide range of NLP applications. One downside of BERT is that it can be computationally expensive, requiring significant resources for training and inference. However, pre-trained BERT models can be fine-tuned for specific use cases, reducing the need for expensive training.\n\nt-SNE\nt-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) is a widely used dimensionality reduction technique for visualizing high-dimensional data. While t-SNE is primarily used for visualization, it can also be used to generate embeddings. The process involves applying t-SNE to reduce the dimensionality of the data and obtaining a lower-dimensional embedding that captures the inherent structure of the original high-dimensional data.\n\nblog image\n\nSource\n\nt-SNE works by creating a probability distribution that measures the similarity between data points in high-dimensional space and a corresponding probability distribution in the low-dimensional space. It then minimizes the Kullback-Leibler divergence between these distributions to find an embedding that preserves the pairwise similarities between points.\n\nThe resulting embeddings from t-SNE can be used for various purposes such as clustering, anomaly detection, or as input to downstream machine learning algorithms. However, it's important to note that t-SNE is computationally expensive, and the generated embeddings should be interpreted carefully since they emphasize local structure and may not preserve the precise distances between points\n\nUMAP\nUMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) is a dimensionality reduction technique commonly used for generating embeddings. Unlike traditional methods like PCA or t-SNE, UMAP focuses on preserving both local and global structure in the data while maintaining computational efficiency.\n\nblog image\n\nSource\n\nUMAP works by constructing a low-dimensional representation of the data while preserving the neighborhood relationships. It achieves this by modeling the data as a topological structure and approximating the manifold on which the data lies. The algorithm iteratively optimizes a low-dimensional embedding that preserves the pairwise distances between nearby points.\n\nApplying UMAP to a dataset generates embeddings that capture the underlying structure and relationships in the data. These embeddings can be used for various purposes, such as visualization, clustering, or as input to other machine learning algorithms.\n\nUMAP has gained popularity in various domains, including image analysis, genomics, text mining, and recommendation systems, due to its ability to generate high-quality embeddings that preserve both local and global structures while being computationally efficient.\n\nAnalyzing and validating embeddings is an important step in quality assurance to ensure that the generated embeddings accurately represent the underlying data.\n\nScale your annotation workflows and power your model performance with data-driven insights\nTry Encord today\nmedical banner\nAnalyzing and Validating Embeddings for Quality Assurance\nOne common method for analyzing embeddings is to visualize them in a lower-dimensional space, such as 2D or 3D, using techniques like t-SNE or PCA. This can help identify clusters or patterns in the data and provide insights into the quality of the embeddings.\n\nThere are platforms that create and plot the embeddings of the dataset. These plots are helpful when you want to visualize your dataset in the lower-dimensional space. Visualizing the data in this lower-dimensional space makes it easier to identify any potential issues or biases in the data, which can be addressed to improve the quality of the embeddings. Visualizing embeddings can help evaluate and compare different models by providing an intuitive way to assess the quality and usefulness of the embeddings for specific tasks.\n\nOne example is the Encord Active platform, which provides a 2D embedding plot of an image dataset, enabling users to visualize the images within a particular cluster. This simplifies the process of identifying outliers through embeddings. The 2D embedding plot is not only useful in validating the data quality but also the label quality of the dataset.\n\nblog image\n\nA 2D embedding plot of the Rareplanes dataset\n\nValidation of embeddings involves evaluating their performance on downstream tasks, such as classification or prediction, and comparing it with other methods. This can help determine the effectiveness of the embeddings in real-world scenarios and highlight areas for improvement.\n\nAnother aspect of validation is measuring the degree of bias present in the embeddings. This is important because embeddings can reflect biases in the training data, leading to discriminatory or unfair outcomes. Techniques like de-biasing can be used to remove these biases and ensure that the embeddings are fair and unbiased.\n\nvector-try-encord\nScale your annotation workflows and power your model performance with data-driven insights\nTry Encord today\nmedical banner\nNow that we have explored the creation and analysis of embeddings, let's examine a case study to gain a deeper understanding of how embeddings can benefit machine learning models when compared to traditional machine learning algorithms.\n\nCase Study: Embeddings and Object Classification\nThis case study focuses on the effect of embeddings on object classification algorithms. By visualizing the embeddings of the training dataset, we can explore their impact on the process.\n\nImage classification is a popular application of machine learning, and embeddings are effective for this task. Embedding-based approaches to image classification involve learning a lower-dimensional representation of the image data and using this representation as input to a machine learning model.\n\nblog image\n\nExample of dog classification \n\nAnalyzing the embeddings can reduce the need for manual feature engineering. Compared to traditional machine learning algorithms, embedding-based approaches enable more efficient computation. Hence, the trained model will often achieve higher accuracy and better generalization to new, unseen data. Let's visualize the embeddings to understand this better.\n\nVisualizing embeddings\nHere, we will be using the Encord Active platform to visualize the embedding plot of the Caltech-101 dataset. \n\nThe Caltech-101 dataset consists of images of objects categorized into 101 classes. Each image in the dataset has different dimensions, but they are generally of medium resolution, with dimensions ranging from 200 x 200 to 500 x 500 pixels. However, the number of dimensions in the dataset will depend on the number of features used to represent each image. In general, most Caltech-101 image features will have hundreds or thousands of dimensions and it will be helpful to visualize it in lower-dimensional space.\n\nblog image\n\nExample of images presented in Caltech101 dataset\n\nSource\n\nRun the following commands in your favorite Python environment with the following commands will download Encord Active:\n\npython3.9 -m venv ea-venv\nsource ea-venv/bin/activate\n# within venv\npip install encord-active\nOr you can follow through the following command to install Encord Active using GitHub:\n\npip install git+https://github.com/encord-team/encord-active\nTo check if Encord Active has been installed, run:\n\nencord-active --help\nEncord Active has many sandbox datasets like the MNIST, BDD100K, TACO dataset, and much more. Caltech101 dataset is one of them. These sandbox datasets are commonly used in computer vision applications for building benchmark models.\n\nNow that you have Encord Active installed, let\u2019s download the Caltech101 dataset by running the command:\n\nencord-active download\nThe script asks you to choose a project, navigate the options \u2193 and \u2191 select the Caltech-101 train or test dataset, and hit enter. The dataset has been pre-divided into a training set comprising 60% of the data and a testing set comprising the rest 40% of the data for the convenience of analyzing the dataset.\n\nEasy! Now, you got your data. To visualize the data in the browser, run the command:\n\ncd /path/to/downloaded/project\nencord-active visualize\nThe image below shows the webpage that opens in your browser showing the training data and its properties.\n\nblog image\n\nVisualize the data in your browser (data = Caltech-101 training data-60% of Caltech-101 dataset)\n\nThe 2D embedding plot can be found in the Explorer pages of the Data Quality and Label Quality sections.\n\nblog image\n\nThe 2D embedding plot in the Data Quality Explorer page of Encord.\n\nThe 2D embedding plot here is a scatter plot with each point representing a data point in the dataset. The position of each point on the plot reflects the relative similarity or dissimilarity of the data points with respect to each other. For example, select the box or the Lasso Select in the upper right corner of the plot. Once you select a region, you can visualize the images only in the selected region.\n\nblog image\n\nBy projecting the data into two dimensions, you can now see clusters of similar data points, outliers, and other patterns that may be useful for data analysis.\n\nblog image\n\nFor example, we see in the selected cluster, there is one outlier.\n\nThe 2D embedding plot in label quality shows the data points of each image and each color represents the class the object belongs to. This helps in finding out the outliers by spotting the unexpected relationships or possible areas of model bias for object labels. \n\nThis plot also shows the separability of the dataset. A separable dataset is useful for object recognition because it allows for the use of simpler and more efficient computer vision models that can achieve high accuracy with relatively few parameters. \n\nblog image\n\nThe 2D embedding plot in the Label Quality Explorer page of Encord.\n\nA separable dataset is a useful starting point for object classification, as it allows us to quickly develop and evaluate simple machine learning models before exploring more complex models if needed. It also helps us better understand the data and the features that distinguish the different classes of objects, which can be useful for developing more sophisticated models in the future.\n\n\ud83d\udca1Read the detailed analysis of the Caltech101 dataset to understand the dataset better.

It\u2019s essential to carefully consider the data and the task at hand before selecting an embedding technique. It is also important to remember the computational resources required for the embedding technique and the size of the resulting embeddings.\n\nIt\u2019s also important to stay up to date with the latest research and techniques in the field of AI embeddings. This can help ensure that the most effective and efficient embedding techniques are used for creating high-quality training data.\n\nAddressing Data Bias and Ensuring Data Diversity\nUsing a large and diverse dataset for generating embeddings for the training data is a good way to ensure the embeddings address the bias in the dataset. This helps capture the full range of variation in the data and results in more accurate embeddings.\n\nValidating the Embeddings\nAnalyzing the embeddings to validate their quality is a crucial step. The embeddings should be evaluated and validated to ensure that they capture the relevant information and can be used effectively for the task at hand. Visualization of the embeddings in a lower-dimensional space can help identify any patterns or clusters in the data and aid in the validation process.\n\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, AI embeddings are powerful tools for creating high-quality training data in machine learning. By using embeddings, data scientists can improve data quality, reduce the need for manual data labeling, and enable more efficient computation. Best practices for using AI embeddings include:\n\nChoosing appropriate techniques.\nAddressing data bias and ensuring diversity.\nUnderstanding limitations that could impact data quality.\nAI embeddings have a promising future in machine learning, and we recommend implementing them in data creation whenever possible.\n\nFuture Directions\nIn the future, we can expect to see more sophisticated embedding techniques and tools, as well as increased use of embeddings in a wide range of applications beyond image and text classification. For example, Meta AI\u2019s new model ImageBIND is a machine learning model that creates a joint embedding space for multiple modalities, such as images, text, and audio.

This is particularly useful in scenarios where the data needs to be more structured or contain missing values. For example, in natural language processing, word embeddings can represent words with similar meanings closer together, enabling better semantic understanding and enhancing the accuracy of various language-related tasks.\n\n\ud83d\udca1Read 5 ways to improve the quality of the training data.\nReducing the Need for Manual Data Labeling\nAI embeddings can automatically label data based on its embedding representation. This can save time and resources, especially when dealing with large datasets.\n\nReducing Computation\nEmbeddings are useful in reducing computation by representing high-dimensional data in a lower-dimensional space. For example, a 256 x 256 image contains 65,536 pixels in image processing, resulting in many features if directly used. Using a CNN, the image can be transformed into a 1000-dimensional feature vector, consolidating the information. This compression significantly reduces computational requirements, approximately 65 times less, allowing for more efficient image processing and analysis without sacrificing essential details.\n\nEnhancing Natual Language Processing (NLP)\nWord embeddings are widely used in NLP applications such as sentiment analysis, language translation, and chatbot development. Mapping words to vector representations makes it easier for machine learning algorithms to understand the relationships between words.\n\nblog image\n\nSource\n\nImproving Recommendation Systems\nCollaborative filtering, a type of recommendation system uses user and item embeddings to make personalized recommendations. By embedding user and item data in a vector space, the algorithm, can identify similar items and recommend them to users.\n\nEnhancing Image and Video Processing\nImage and video embeddings can be used for object detection, recognition, and classification. Mapping images and videos to vector representations makes it easier for machine learning algorithms to identify and classify different objects within them.\n\nHence, the applications of AI embeddings are diverse and offer many benefits, including improving data quality and reducing the need for manual data labeling. Now, let's delve into how this can be beneficial when utilizing AI embeddings for generating high-quality training data.\n\nFrom scaling to enhancing your model development with data-driven insights\nLearn more\nmedical banner\nBenefits of Embeddings in Data Creation\nHere are a few of the benefits of using embeddings in data creation:\n\nCreate a Larger and Diverse Dataset\nBy automatically identifying patterns and relationships within data, embeddings can help to fill in gaps and identify outliers that might be missed by manual labeling. For example, embeddings can help fill in gaps by leveraging the learned patterns and relationships within the data. \n\nAI models can make informed estimations or predictions for missing values by analyzing the surrounding representations, allowing for more complete and reliable data analysis. This can help improve the accuracy of machine learning models by providing more comprehensive and representative data for training.\n\nblog image\n\nSource\n\nReduce Bias\nUsing AI embeddings in training data can help reduce bias by enabling a more nuanced understanding of the relationships and patterns in the data, allowing for identifying and mitigating potential sources of bias. This can help to ensure that machine learning models are trained on fair and representative data, leading to more accurate and unbiased predictions.\n\n\ud83d\udca1Read to find out five more ways to reduce bias in your training data.\nImprove Model Performance\nAI embeddings offer several benefits such as increased efficiency, better generalization, and enhanced performance in various machine learning tasks. They enable efficient computation and discovery of complex patterns, reduce overfitting, and capture the underlying structure of the data to generalize better on new, unseen data.\n\nHow to Create High-Quality Training Data Using Embeddings\nData Preparation\nThe first step is preparing the data for embedding. The data preparation step is crucial for embedding because the input data's quality determines the resulting embeddings' quality. \n\nThe first step is to collect the data you want to use for training your model. This can include text data, image data, or graph data. Once you have collected the data, you need to clean and preprocess it to remove any noise or irrelevant information. For example, in text data, data cleaning involves:\n\nTokenizing the text into individual words or phrases.\nRemoving stop words.\nCorrecting spelling errors.\nRemoving punctuation marks.\nYou may need to resize or crop images to a uniform size for image data.\n\nIf the data is noisy, unstructured, or contains irrelevant information, the embeddings may not accurately represent the data and may not provide the desired results. Proper data preparation can help improve the quality of embeddings, leading to more accurate and efficient machine learning models. \n\nFor example, the pre-processing step of image data preparation involves removing image duplicates and images that have no information like extremely dark or overly bright images.\n\n\ud83d\udca1Read the blog on data curation and data curation tools to gain more insight on how to choose the right datasets for your computer vision or machine learning model.\nEmbedding using Machine Learning Techniques\nMost machine learning algorithms require numerical data as input. Therefore, you need to convert the data into a numerical format. This can involve creating a bag of words representation for text data, converting images into pixel values, or transforming graph data into a numerical matrix.\n\nOnce you have converted the data into a numerical format, you can embed it using machine learning techniques. The embedding process involves mapping the data from a higher-dimensional space to a lower-dimensional space while preserving its semantic meaning. Some of the popular embedding techniques are:\n\nScale your annotation workflows and power your model performance with data-driven insights\nTry Encord today\nmedical banner\nPrincipal Component Analysis (PCA) & Single Value Decomposition (SVD)\nPrincipal Component Analysis (PCA) is a dimensionality reduction technique that transforms the original data into a set of new, uncorrelated features (called principal components). It captures the most important information in the data while discarding the less important information.\n\nTo perform PCA for embedding, the original data is first centered and scaled to have zero mean and unit variance. Next, the covariance matrix of the centered data is calculated. The eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the covariance matrix are then computed, and the eigenvectors are sorted in descending order based on their corresponding eigenvalues. The top k eigenvectors are then selected to form the new feature space, where k is the desired dimensionality of the embedded space.\n\nblog image\n\nAn example where we transform five data points using PCA. The left graph is our original data; the right graph would be our transformed data. The two charts show the same data, but the right graph reflects the original data transformed so that the axes are now the principal components.\n\nSource\n\nFinally, the original data is projected onto the new feature space using the selected eigenvectors to obtain the embedded representation. PCA is a widely used technique for embedding, particularly for image and audio data, and has been used in a variety of applications such as facial recognition and speech recognition.\n\nSingular Value Decomposition (SVD) is used within PCA, so we will only cover this briefly. SVD decomposes a matrix into three matrices: U, \u03a3, and V. U represents the left singular vectors, S represents the singular values, and V represents the right singular vectors.\n\nblog image\n\nEquation of the SVD theorem.\n\nThe singular values and vectors capture the most important information in the original matrix, allowing for dimensionality reduction and embedding creation. Similar to PCA, SVD can be used to create embeddings for various types of data, including text, images, and graphs.\n\nSVD has been used for various machine learning tasks, such as recommendation systems, text classification, and image processing. It is a powerful technique for creating high-quality embeddings that can improve the performance of machine learning models.\n\nAuto-Encoder\nAutoencoders are neural network models used for unsupervised learning. They consist of an encoder network that maps the input data to a lower-dimensional representation (encoding) and a decoder network that attempts to reconstruct the original input data from the encoding. An autoencoder aims to learn a compressed and meaningful representation of the input data, effectively capturing the essential features.\n\nAutoencoders consist of an encoder neural network that compresses the input data into a lower-dimensional representation or embedding. The decoder network reconstructs the original data from the embedding. By training an eutoencoder on a dataset, the encoder network learns to extract meaningful features and compress the input data into a compact representation. These embeddings can be used for downstream tasks such as clustering, visualization, or transfer learning. \n\nWord2Vec\nWord2Vec is a popular technique for creating word embeddings, which represent words in a high-dimensional vector space. The technique works by training a neural network on a large corpus of text data, to predict the context in which a given word appears. The resulting embeddings capture semantic and syntactic relationships between words, such as similarity and analogy.\n\nWord2Vec is effective in various natural language processing tasks, such as language translation, text classification, and sentiment analysis. It also has applications in recommendation systems and image analysis.\n\nThere are two main approaches to implementing Word2Vec: the Continuous Bag-of-Words (CBOW) model and the Skip-gram model. CBOW predicts a target word given its surrounding context, while Skip-gram predicts the context given a target word. Both models have their advantages and disadvantages, and the choice between them depends on the specific application and the characteristics of the data.\n\nblog image\n\nLeft: CBOW architecture. Right: Skip-gram architecture. The CBOW architecture predicts the current word based on the context, and the Skip-gram predicts surrounding words given the current word.\n\nSource\n\nGloVe\nGloVe, which stands for Global Vectors for Word Representation, is another popular embedding technique that is used to represent words as vectors. Like Word2Vec, GloVe is also a neural network-based approach. However, unlike Word2Vec, which is based on a shallow neural network, GloVe uses a global matrix factorization technique to learn word embeddings.\n\nIn GloVe, the co-occurrence matrix of words is constructed by counting the number of times two words appear together in a given context. The rows of the matrix represent the words, and the columns represent the context in which the words appear. The matrix is then factorized into two separate matrices, one for words and the other for contexts. The product of these two matrices produces the final word embeddings.\n\nblog image\n\nExample of the GloVe embeddings.\n\nSource\n\nGloVe is known to perform well on various NLP tasks such as word analogy, word similarity, and named entity recognition. Additionally, GloVe has also been used for image classification tasks by converting image features into word-like entities and applying GloVe embeddings.\n\nBERT\nBERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a popular language model developed by Google that has been used for a variety of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including embedding. BERT is a deep learning model that uses a transformer architecture to generate word embeddings by taking into account the context of the words. This allows BERT to capture the semantic meaning of words, as well as the relationships between words in a sentence.\n\nblog image\n\nBERT is a pre-trained model that has been trained on massive amounts of text data, making it a powerful tool for generating high-quality word embeddings. BERT-based embeddings are highly effective in a range of NLP tasks, including sentiment analysis, text classification, and question-answering. Additionally, BERT allows for fine-tuning specific downstream tasks, which can lead to even more accurate results.\n\nblog image\n\nOverall pre-training and fine-tuning procedure for BERT\n\nSource\n\nOverall, BERT is a powerful tool for generating high-quality word embeddings that can be used in a wide range of NLP applications. One downside of BERT is that it can be computationally expensive, requiring significant resources for training and inference. However, pre-trained BERT models can be fine-tuned for specific use cases, reducing the need for expensive training.\n\nt-SNE\nt-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) is a widely used dimensionality reduction technique for visualizing high-dimensional data. While t-SNE is primarily used for visualization, it can also be used to generate embeddings. The process involves applying t-SNE to reduce the dimensionality of the data and obtaining a lower-dimensional embedding that captures the inherent structure of the original high-dimensional data.\n\nblog image\n\nSource\n\nt-SNE works by creating a probability distribution that measures the similarity between data points in high-dimensional space and a corresponding probability distribution in the low-dimensional space. It then minimizes the Kullback-Leibler divergence between these distributions to find an embedding that preserves the pairwise similarities between points.\n\nThe resulting embeddings from t-SNE can be used for various purposes such as clustering, anomaly detection, or as input to downstream machine learning algorithms. However, it's important to note that t-SNE is computationally expensive, and the generated embeddings should be interpreted carefully since they emphasize local structure and may not preserve the precise distances between points\n\nUMAP\nUMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) is a dimensionality reduction technique commonly used for generating embeddings. Unlike traditional methods like PCA or t-SNE, UMAP focuses on preserving both local and global structure in the data while maintaining computational efficiency.\n\nblog image\n\nSource\n\nUMAP works by constructing a low-dimensional representation of the data while preserving the neighborhood relationships. It achieves this by modeling the data as a topological structure and approximating the manifold on which the data lies. The algorithm iteratively optimizes a low-dimensional embedding that preserves the pairwise distances between nearby points.\n\nApplying UMAP to a dataset generates embeddings that capture the underlying structure and relationships in the data. These embeddings can be used for various purposes, such as visualization, clustering, or as input to other machine learning algorithms.\n\nUMAP has gained popularity in various domains, including image analysis, genomics, text mining, and recommendation systems, due to its ability to generate high-quality embeddings that preserve both local and global structures while being computationally efficient.\n\nAnalyzing and validating embeddings is an important step in quality assurance to ensure that the generated embeddings accurately represent the underlying data.\n\nScale your annotation workflows and power your model performance with data-driven insights\nTry Encord today\nmedical banner\nAnalyzing and Validating Embeddings for Quality Assurance\nOne common method for analyzing embeddings is to visualize them in a lower-dimensional space, such as 2D or 3D, using techniques like t-SNE or PCA. This can help identify clusters or patterns in the data and provide insights into the quality of the embeddings.\n\nThere are platforms that create and plot the embeddings of the dataset. These plots are helpful when you want to visualize your dataset in the lower-dimensional space. Visualizing the data in this lower-dimensional space makes it easier to identify any potential issues or biases in the data, which can be addressed to improve the quality of the embeddings. Visualizing embeddings can help evaluate and compare different models by providing an intuitive way to assess the quality and usefulness of the embeddings for specific tasks.\n\nOne example is the Encord Active platform, which provides a 2D embedding plot of an image dataset, enabling users to visualize the images within a particular cluster. This simplifies the process of identifying outliers through embeddings. The 2D embedding plot is not only useful in validating the data quality but also the label quality of the dataset.\n\nblog image\n\nA 2D embedding plot of the Rareplanes dataset\n\nValidation of embeddings involves evaluating their performance on downstream tasks, such as classification or prediction, and comparing it with other methods. This can help determine the effectiveness of the embeddings in real-world scenarios and highlight areas for improvement.\n\nAnother aspect of validation is measuring the degree of bias present in the embeddings. This is important because embeddings can reflect biases in the training data, leading to discriminatory or unfair outcomes. Techniques like de-biasing can be used to remove these biases and ensure that the embeddings are fair and unbiased.\n\nvector-try-encord\nScale your annotation workflows and power your model performance with data-driven insights\nTry Encord today\nmedical banner\nNow that we have explored the creation and analysis of embeddings, let's examine a case study to gain a deeper understanding of how embeddings can benefit machine learning models when compared to traditional machine learning algorithms.\n\nCase Study: Embeddings and Object Classification\nThis case study focuses on the effect of embeddings on object classification algorithms. By visualizing the embeddings of the training dataset, we can explore their impact on the process.\n\nImage classification is a popular application of machine learning, and embeddings are effective for this task. Embedding-based approaches to image classification involve learning a lower-dimensional representation of the image data and using this representation as input to a machine learning model.\n\nblog image\n\nExample of dog classification \n\nAnalyzing the embeddings can reduce the need for manual feature engineering. Compared to traditional machine learning algorithms, embedding-based approaches enable more efficient computation. Hence, the trained model will often achieve higher accuracy and better generalization to new, unseen data. Let's visualize the embeddings to understand this better.\n\nVisualizing embeddings\nHere, we will be using the Encord Active platform to visualize the embedding plot of the Caltech-101 dataset. \n\nThe Caltech-101 dataset consists of images of objects categorized into 101 classes. Each image in the dataset has different dimensions, but they are generally of medium resolution, with dimensions ranging from 200 x 200 to 500 x 500 pixels. However, the number of dimensions in the dataset will depend on the number of features used to represent each image. In general, most Caltech-101 image features will have hundreds or thousands of dimensions and it will be helpful to visualize it in lower-dimensional space.\n\nblog image\n\nExample of images presented in Caltech101 dataset\n\nSource\n\nRun the following commands in your favorite Python environment with the following commands will download Encord Active:\n\npython3.9 -m venv ea-venv\nsource ea-venv/bin/activate\n# within venv\npip install encord-active\nOr you can follow through the following command to install Encord Active using GitHub:\n\npip install git+https://github.com/encord-team/encord-active\nTo check if Encord Active has been installed, run:\n\nencord-active --help\nEncord Active has many sandbox datasets like the MNIST, BDD100K, TACO dataset, and much more.

The position of each point on the plot reflects the relative similarity or dissimilarity of the data points with respect to each other. For example, select the box or the Lasso Select in the upper right corner of the plot. Once you select a region, you can visualize the images only in the selected region.\n\nblog image\n\nBy projecting the data into two dimensions, you can now see clusters of similar data points, outliers, and other patterns that may be useful for data analysis.\n\nblog image\n\nFor example, we see in the selected cluster, there is one outlier.\n\nThe 2D embedding plot in label quality shows the data points of each image and each color represents the class the object belongs to. This helps in finding out the outliers by spotting the unexpected relationships or possible areas of model bias for object labels. \n\nThis plot also shows the separability of the dataset. A separable dataset is useful for object recognition because it allows for the use of simpler and more efficient computer vision models that can achieve high accuracy with relatively few parameters. \n\nblog image\n\nThe 2D embedding plot in the Label Quality Explorer page of Encord.\n\nA separable dataset is a useful starting point for object classification, as it allows us to quickly develop and evaluate simple machine learning models before exploring more complex models if needed. It also helps us better understand the data and the features that distinguish the different classes of objects, which can be useful for developing more sophisticated models in the future.\n\n\ud83d\udca1Read the detailed analysis of the Caltech101 dataset to understand the dataset better.

This helps capture the full range of variation in the data and results in more accurate embeddings.\n\nValidating the Embeddings\nAnalyzing the embeddings to validate their quality is a crucial step. The embeddings should be evaluated and validated to ensure that they capture the relevant information and can be used effectively for the task at hand.
